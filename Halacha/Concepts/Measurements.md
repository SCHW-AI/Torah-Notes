## Depths of Absorption:

### Surface Level:
When two items come in contact, they will often leave residue on the surface of the other. If that residue must be removed, such as when kosher meat comes into contact with non-kosher meat and the residue of the non-kosher meat must therefore be removed from the kosher meat so it is not consumed with the kosher meat, the removal can be accomplished by rinsing the point of contact (הדחה), although for some, more oily things (such as rendered fat, see פ"ת יו"ד ס' צא ס"ק א), scrubbing the point of contact is required (שפשוף).
#### גרידה:
When soft, wet surfaces, such as the inside of cucumbers, cannot have substances removed from their surfaces by rinsing, as rinsing such items will not only fail to remove the prohibited substance, it will in fact push it deeper into the surface. The solution in such cases is, therefore, to remove the prohibited substance by means of scraping the surface to remove a very small amount of the surface and the prohibited substance with it (שו"ע צו:ה).
### כדי קליפה:
There are certain flavor transfers that only penetrate to a minimal depth within the target, the depth being the thinnest layer of that substance that can be peeled away without falling apart. This is referred to as כדי קליפה (lit. to the point of peeling), and the area of absorption is itself referred to as a כדי קליפה or just the קליפה.
### כדי נטילה:
There are certain flavor transfers that penetrate a fingerbreadth into the target. Such cases are referred to as absorbing כדי נטילה (lit. to the point of removal), and the area of absorption is itself referred to as a כדי נטילה or just the נטילה.
