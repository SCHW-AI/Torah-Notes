# מליח כרותח:
Salted food is capable of emitting its [[תערובות#בליעות & טעם כעיקר|בליעות]] into food it comes into contact with. This law is referred to as מליח כרותח, which directly translates as "Salted is like Heated", because the primary method of transferring בליעות is heat. This only applies to meat that is too salty to be eaten as is (אינו נאכל מחמת מלחו).

## Levels of Salting:
Not just any salting qualifies as מליח כרותח; there are specific requirements for both the quantity of salt required, as well as for how long the salt must be on the food.

### מליח לקדירה:
The most basic level is מליח לקדירה (lit. salting for the pot), which is the level of salting required to kasher (draw out the blood) meat, which requires fully coating the surface of the meat with salt. The status of  מליח כרותח begins immediately and continues for the length of time it takes a pot to boil, which is approximately 18 minutes, at which point all of the blood has been expelled and the salt's strength is considered spent.

If this level of salting was applied to kashered (bloodless) meat (or any other substance), the status of מליח כרותח doesn't start until after 18 minutes, and it continues so long as the salt is present, because there's no blood extraction to spend its strength.

The reason for this distinction is that salt is not רותח in a vacuum — it needs to be acting on something. Therefore, when bloody meat is salted and immediately begins expelling blood, it is immediately considered רותח. However, when the meat doesn't contain any blood, nothing is happening when the salt is first placed on the meat and so there is no רתיחות. Once the salt has been on for 18 minutes, the meat itself absorbs the salt, and salty meat is always considered רותח.

### מליח לצלי:
The lowest level of salting is מליח לצלי, which is the amount of salt that one places on meat to season it for roasting (or any other cooking method).
### מליח להצניע: 
The level above מליח לקדירה is מליח להצניע, which is salting to preserve for storage.
### מליח לדרך:
The most intense level of salting is מליח לדרך, salting to preserve for travel, which needs a higher level of salting than [[#מליח להצניע|salting for storage]] so that it can withstand exposure to the elements.
