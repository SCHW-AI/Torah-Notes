# מליח כרותח:
Salted food is capable of emitting its [[תערובות#בליעות & טעם כעיקר|בליעות]] into food it comes into contact with. This law is referred to as מליח כרותח, which directly translates as "Salted is like Heated", because the primary method of transferring בליעות is heat. 

## Levels of Salting:
Not just any salting qualifies as מליח כרותח; there are specific requirements for both the quantity of salt required, as well as for how long the salt must be on the food.

### מליח לקדירה:
The most basic level is salting for kashering (drawing the blood out of the meat), which requires fully coating the surface of the meat with salt. The status of  מליח כרותח begins immediately and continues for the length of time it takes a pot to boil, which is approximately 18 minutes, at which point all of the blood has been expelled and the salt's strength is considered spent.
Salting for cooking is a lesser level of salting than salting for kashering. As far as quantity, it's not clear exactly how much salt this is, but it's a significant amount of salt. Unlike salting for kashering, the status of מליח כרותח doesn't start until after 18 minutes, and it continues so long as the salt is present, because there's no blood extraction to spend its strength.

### מליח לצלי:
The lowest level of salting is מליח לצלי, which is the amount of salt that one places on meat to season it for roasting (or any other cooking method).

### מליח להצניע:
The most intense level of salting is מליח להצניע, salting to preserve.
