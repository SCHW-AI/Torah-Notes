# מליח כרותח:
Salted food is capable of emitting its [[תערובות#בליעות & טעם כעיקר|בליעות]] into food it comes into contact with. This law is referred to as מליח כרותח, which directly translates as "Salted is like Heated", because the primary method of transferring בליעות is heat. This only applies to meat that is too salty to be eaten as is (אינו נאכל מחמת מלחו).

## Levels of Salting:
Not just any salting qualifies as מליח כרותח; there are specific requirements for both the quantity of salt required, as well as for how long the salt must be on the food.

### מליח לקדירה:
The most basic level is מליח לקדירה (lit. salting for the pot), which is the level of salting required to kasher (draw out the blood) meat, which requires fully coating the surface of the meat with salt. The status of  מליח כרותח begins immediately and continues for the length of time it takes a pot to boil, which is approximately 18 minutes, at which point all of the blood has been expelled and the salt's strength is considered spent.

If this level of salting was applied to kashered (bloodless) meat (or any other substance), the status of מליח כרותח doesn't start until after 18 minutes, and it continues so long as the salt is present, because there's no blood extraction to spend its strength (שו"ע צא:ה).

The reason for this distinction is that salt is not רותח in a vacuum — it needs to be acting on something. Therefore, when bloody meat is salted and immediately begins expelling blood, it is immediately considered רותח. However, when the meat doesn't contain any blood, nothing is happening when the salt is first placed on the meat and so there is no רתיחות. Once the salt has been on for 18 minutes, the meat itself absorbs the salt, and salty meat is always considered רותח.

The ש"ך (שם ס"ק יא) says that this distinction, as far as when the רתיחות *starts*, is the opinion of the רן and is rejected by nearly all other ראשנים. He therefore rules that one must treat even bloodless meat as רותח as soon as the salt is placed upon it.

The רמ"א (צא:ה) cites an opinion that disagrees with this distinction, as far as when the רתיחות *ends*, and says that even bloodless meat ceases to be רותח after 18 minutes. He rules that one may rely on this opinion in extenuating circumstances, such as a significant financial loss (הפסד מרובה) or if the food is needed for a סעודת מצוה.

### מליח לצלי:
The lowest level of salting is מליח לצלי, which is the amount of salt that one places on meat to season it for roasting (or any other cooking method). This level of salting has no effect as far as מליח כרותח, and if meat that is salted to this level touches cheese, it is treated the same [[בשר בחלב#General Contact|as if it was unsalted]]. The רמ"א (צא:ה) says that nowadays that we are not experts in what is considered אינו נאכל מחמת מלחו, even מליח לצלי should be treated as רותח except where such a ruling would result in a significant financial loss.
#### Drippings:
Although meat that is מליח לצלי is itself not אינו נאכל מחמת מלחו and is therefore not רותח, the drippings of such meat is אינו נאכל מחמת מלחו and, therefore, רותח (see רמ"א שם).

### מליח להצניע: 
The level above מליח לקדירה is מליח להצניע, which is salting to preserve for storage.
### מליח לדרך:
The most intense level of salting is מליח לדרך, salting to preserve for travel, which needs a higher level of salting than [[#מליח להצניע|salting for storage]] so that it can withstand exposure to the elements.

## How "רותח" is מליח כרותח?
When food is אינו נאכל מחמת מלחו and therefore obtains the status of מליח כרותח, what flavor transfer(s) this effects is subject to dispute. The שו"ע (צא:ה) rules that salted food imparts flavor but does not absorb flavor, and it imparts its flavor to the depth of a [[Measurements#כדי קליפה|קליפה]] ([[#Depth of Flavor Transfer|when it's not fatty]]). Therefore, if salted meat comes into contact with unsalted cheese or vice versa, the unsalted food needs קליפה while the salted food just needs [[Measurements#Surface Level|הדחה]]. If both were salted then both need קליפה, as each imparts its flavor to the other. If both items were dry they don't impart flavor, even though they are salted. If even one of them is moist, even only the unsalted, then the salted imparts its flavor using the moisture as a medium.

The רמ"א (שם) rules that this that the salted only imparts and doesn't absorb is when the unsalted substance is solid; If it's liquid, the salted substance will absorb some of it. If the salted substance was fully dry, however, it wouldn't even absorb liquid^[This obviously only holds true until the liquid penetrates the dry substance and rehydrates it.].

### Depth of Flavor Transfer:
Food that reaches the status of מליח כרותח imparts its flavor to the depth of a קליפה, unless the salted food is fatty, in which case the fat carries the flavor throughout the second substance. Not only that, if the second (non-fatty) food is also salted and would normally only impart its flavor to the depth of a קליפה, the fat of the first food permeates it and makes the second food fatty as well, which in turn imparts its flavor throughout the first food (שו"ע צא:ו).

The רמ"א (קה:ט) says that we are not experts at discerning between fatty and not fatty and so anything that can be fatty, like meat, must be treated as such. We don't have such a concern about substances that *can't* be fatty, such as חמץ, and so they only impart flavor to the depth of a קליפה.
