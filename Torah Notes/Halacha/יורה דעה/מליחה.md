# מליח כרותח:
Salted food is capable of emitting its [[תערובות#בליעות & טעם כעיקר|בליעות]] into food it comes into contact with. This law is referred to as מליח כרותח, which directly translates as "Salted is like Heated", because the primary method of transferring בליעות is heat. 

## Levels of Salting:
Not just any salting qualifies as מליח כרותח; there are specific requirements for both the quantity of salt required, as well as for how long the salt must be on the food
