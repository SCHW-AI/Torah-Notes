# מליח כרותח:
Salted food is capable of emitting its [[תערובות#בליעות & טעם כעיקר|בליעות]] into food it comes into contact with. This law is referred to as מליח כרותח, which directly translates as "Salted is like Heated", because the primary method of transferring בליעות is heat.

Not just any salting qualifies as מליח כרותח; there are specific requirements for both the quantity of salt required, as well as for how long the salt must be on the food.

The most basic level is salting for kashering (drawing the blood out of the meat), which requires fully coating the surface of the meat with salt (quantity) and leaving it that way for the length of time it takes a pot to boil, which is approximately 18 minutes (length of time).

### Salting for Roasting:
Salting for roasting is a lesser level of salting than salting for kashering,
