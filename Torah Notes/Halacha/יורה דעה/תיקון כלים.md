There are two main scenarios that utensils would need rectification to be usable with food:

## טבילת כלים:

## הסרת בליעות:
When utensils absorb undesirable בליעות (whether non-kosher, חמץ before פסח, or  meat/milk when the owner wants to use the utensil for milk/meat), the method for removing those בליעות depends on two factors: the material from which the utensil is made and the method of cooking that imparted the בליעות.
### Materials:
#### Earthenware:
Earthenware can never be fully purged of בליעות, so an earthenware utensil that absorbs from forbidden foods will forever prohibit anything cooked in it. If it absorbed from חמץ it cannot be used on פסח and in fact must be destroyed before פסח if not sold to a non-jew, and if it was used for meat/milk it can never be used for milk/meat.

This is all the case if the flavor was absorbed throughout the utensil. If, however, it was only absorbed to the depth of a [[Measurements#כדי קליפה|קליפה]], one has the option to remove the קליפה (through sanding, for example) if he so desires (ש"ך יו"ד ס' צא  ס"ק יח), although the פ"ת (שם ס"ק ח) discusses the possibility that earthenware always absorbs throughout which would render קליפה irrelevant. ^0a49ff

#### Glass: 
According to most authorities, glass is incapable of absorbing בליעות and so can never become prohibited (or חמץ or meat/milk) to begin with.
#### Metal:
Metal utensils can be purged of בליעות but the method required depends on how the בליעות entered. The removal method needs to be at least as intense as the way the בליעות entered to begin with, therefore בליעות that require a lower method can be purged by a higher method. The methods are:
##### הגעלה:
Utensils that have absorbed בליעות through cooking require הגעלה, immersion in boiling water. ^916163
##### ליבון קל:
Utensils that require [[#^916163|הגעלה]] can, in situations where הגעלה isn't practical, be heated to [[תערובות#^764657|יד סולדת]] and that suffices to remove the בליעות.
##### ליבון גמור:
When a utensil has absorbed בליעות through exposure to an open flame, such as roasting or grilling, it requires ליבון (lit. whitening), which is heating the metal to the point that it, according to various opinions, is red hot, emits sparks, or achieves the temperature the food was roasted at.

#### Wood:
Wood seems to be treated like [[#Metal:|metal]], although [[תיקון כלים#ליבון גמור|ליבון גמור]] is obviously not applicable, because wood can't be heated to that temperature without burning. Like [[#^0a49ff|earthenware]], one also has the option to be קולף the wood if it absorbed something כדי קליפה.
