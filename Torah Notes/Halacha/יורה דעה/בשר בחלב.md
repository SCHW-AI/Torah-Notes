## The Prohibition:
The Torah prohibits [[בישול - Cooking#^8df37a|cooking]] meat and milk together, and prohibits the product of such cooking from being eaten or benefitted from (ש"ע פז:א).

The derivation for this law is as follows: the Torah writes (שמות כג:יט, שם לד:כו, דברים יד:כא) לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו (Thou shalt not cook a goat in its mother's milk) three times. The ברייתא says ([:גמ' חולין קטו](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=115b&format=pdf)) that the Torah wrote this פסוק three times in order to prohibit cooking (1), eating (2), and benefitting from (3) a combination of meat and milk. ^ba43d4

The רשב"א teaches (:ת"ה הקצר ב"ג ש"ד פד) an important caveat: the Torah only prohibits eating and benefitting from a combination of meat and milk that have been cooked together. He derives this from the fact that all three פסוקים use the language of "don't cook," even though two of them are referring to eating and benefit, respectively.

It is important to note that this only constitutes an absolute permit to *benefit* from a meat/milk combination that has not been cooked together. *Eating* such a combination, on the other hand, is prohibited מדרבנן.  ^5033f6

Cooking a meat/milk combination of which one or both components are only considered meat or milk מדרבנן is permitted (in regard to the basic הלכה; see below regarding [[מראת עין#^6d2017|מראת עין]]). (שו"ע  פז:ג) As well, benefitting from any meat/milk combination that is only prohibited מדרבנן (whether because of the cooking method or the ingredients) is allowed (רמ"א בהגה פז:א).


## Definitions:
There are three terms that must be defined in order to understand the prohibition of בשר בחלב: [[#Cooking|cooking]], [[#Meat|meat]], and [[#Milk|milk]].


### Cooking: 
In the context of בשר בחלב, cooking has two definitions: a general definition of causing flavor to transfer, and a specific definition of cooking in water or other liquids. When the Torah prohibits cooking meat and milk, it means the second definition of cooking in water (שו"ע פז:א) (when heated by a flame, not [[#Cooking in Hot Springs (חמי טבריא)|the sun or hot springs]]), and possibly [[#Roasting (צלי)|roasting]], [[#Cold into Hot|putting cold meat into hot milk or vice versa]], [[#Pan-Frying|pan-frying]], [[#Smoking (מעושן)|smoking]], and [[#Cooking in Hot Springs (חמי טבריא)|cooking in water heated by hot springs or other non-flame sources]]. ^d7444c

#### Possible דאורייתא Cooking Methods:

##### Roasting (צלי): 
Roasting differs from [[#^d7444c|cooking]] in that the food being roasted is not immersed in liquid, such as on a grill or ungreased griddle.
There is some debate whether roasting בשר בחלב is prohibited מדאורייתא or only מדרבנן.
The פרי חדש is of the opinion that it is מדאורייתא (see ס' פז ס"ק ב for his proofs.) רעק"א (שם) brings proofs that the ר"ן argues and holds that roasting is not a דאורייתא method of cooking בב"ח. ^dbe714
##### Cold into Hot:
![[בישול - Cooking#^ba819c]]

As a consequence of this, when cold milk falls onto hot meat or cold meat falls into hot milk, according to many this would be considered akin to roasting, as the hot base would heat the cold item falling onto it, causing flavors to transfer between them, rendering the mixture בשר בחלב.
###### Hot into Cold:
If hot meat fell into cold milk, the meat needs קליפה. The law regarding the milk is a matter of dispute . According to the ט"ז (ס' צא ס"ק ז), the milk needs [[תערובות#^09539d|ששים]] against the קליפה. According to the ש"ך (שם ס"ק ח), since the קליפה of a liquid mixes in and is not a distinct part, the milk does not need ששים.

The מגן אברהם (הובא ברעק"א שם) agrees with the ש"ך that the milk does not need ששים, but only when the meat did not enter the milk as part of an uninterrupted stream (עירוי שנפסק הקילוח), so even the קליפה transfer is only at the level of a [[בישול - Cooking#כלי שני|כלי שני]] and is not actually אסור. In such a case, the requirement to remove the קליפה from the meat is only a חומרא due to the optics of eating the portion of the meat that came into contact with milk. Such a concern doesn't apply to the milk because there is no distinct קליפה in fluid^[In my opinion, the ש"ך would agree to this, although ר' אברהם אליהו לייביקר disagrees with me. This argument hinges on whether the ש"ך in ס"ק ז that says that the ruling of the שו"ע applies to both נפסק הקילוח and not is referring just to the קליפה of the meat or also to the milk. It would seem that the בית מאיר (הובא באוצר המפרשים) agrees with him, because he asks how the ש"ך can allow the milk to be consumed without ביטול and therefore disagrees with the ש"ך and explains the רמא as we just have בשם המג"א.].

The תשואות חן (הובא בפ"ת שם ס"ק ה) adds that this permit applies to meat and milk, which need to *cook* together to be prohibited מדאוריייתא, but not hot איסור that fell into cool היתר, except בהפסד מרובה, because were the בליעות of איסור to transfer, even without cooking, the food would be אסור מדאורייתא.

If cold milk were poured on hot meat, whether the milk is אסור depends on the speed with which it was poured. If it was poured slowly, all of the milk is אסור, because as the stream hits the meat the milk at the tip of the stream pushes aside the milk already in contact with the meat, so that all of the milk directly contacts the meat and is therefore part of the קליפה (see פ"ת ס"ק ו who brings from the ח"ס).

##### Pan-Frying:
The פרי חדש is of the opinion that it is מדאורייתא (see ס' פז ס"ק ב for his proofs.)
The פ"ת (שם ס"ק ג) brings the מ"י and the מהר"ם שיף who argue and say it is only מדרבנן.

R' Lefkowitz told me that deep frying is considered cooking, not frying. (Although רשי in :סנהדרין ד seems to me to indicate otherwise)
##### Smoking (מעושן):
There is a debate about what kind of smoking is referred to here. It can either mean hot smoking, in a situation where the heat is indirect, or it can mean cold smoking, i.e. sawdust is burned to create a large amount of smoke in an enclosed space where  meat and cheese are in contact, the smoke penetrates the food items and causes flavor to transfer between them.  ^237ec2

Whether smoking is considered בישול in the context of בשר בחלב is an undecided debate in the ירושלמי, so we consider it a ספק דאורייתא (biblical doubt). We therefore treat it like בישול due to the rule of ספק דאורייתא לחומרא (we rule stringently in a biblical doubt), but because it is only  out of doubt the court does not prescribe lashes for such cooking (מגיד משנה הל' מ"א פ"ט ה' ו). The ש"ע (פז:ו) agrees with this מ"מ, but the גר"א (שם ס"ק טו)  argues that smoking *should* be considered cooking דאוריייתא, citing a גמ' שבת that says smoking is considered cooking regarding שבת.^fa19bd

##### Cooking in Hot Springs (חמי טבריא):
Hot springs are used as the Talmudic shorthand for heat that is not derived from fire. The other example of such heat is solar-derived heat. 
It is compared in the ירושלמי to מעושן, so it shares its [[#Smoking (מעושן)|laws]]. ^548c25
###### Electricity:
I spoke with R' Yitzchok Dov Lefkowitz, and he told me that whether electric cooking falls under this category depends on the method of heating: 

A directly solar powered kettle (such as the rooftop hot water heaters common in Israel, known locally as a דוד שמש) is considered by some authorities to be indirectly heated by the sun and by some to be directly heated by the sun (with consequences for the laws of שבת), either way such a kettle would fall under the category of non-flame heats.

A standard electric stove *is* considered by most authorities to be a flame-based heat, because the coil is heated to the point of glowing (like why incandescent bulbs are considered fire for various הלכות).

A microwave and an induction stove are controversial, because R' Moshe Feinstein holds that any normal cooking method is considered בישול, but there are those argue.


#### Definite דרבנן Cooking Methods:
##### Soaking (כבוש):
Soaking food for 24 hours in liquid causes [[תערובות#^2d098f|בליעות]] to transfer as if the mixture and the utensil it is contained in were cooked. However, meat and milk that are soaked together are *not* considered to have been cooked together מדאורייתא, as only flame (or heat, depending on the status of [[#^548c25|חמי טבריא]]) derived cooking is included in the biblical prohibition of בשר בחלב. That said, if one were to cook meat that had been soaked in milk or vice versa, that *would* be cooking בשר בחלב מדאורייתא.

That's all as far as דאורייתא is concerned, but if meat and milk were soaked together they would be [[#^5033f6|prohibited מדרבנן to be eaten]]. 

##### Salting (מליחה):
When salted foods come in contact, [[מליחה#How "רותח" is מליח כרותח?|בליעות are transferred between them]]. As discussed [[#Soaking (כבוש)|above]], this does not constitute cooking מדאורייתא as far as the laws of בב"ח. Therefore, if salted meat and dairy come into contact, they would each be prohibited to be eaten מדרבנן and to be cooked מדאורייתא (since they each contain בליעות)
#### Meat and Milk Combined Without Cooking:
As discussed [[#^5033f6|above]], meat and milk cannot be eaten together, even if not cooked together. This differs from even דרבנן cooking methods in that there is no בליעה transfer at all. This is why, for example, a deli and cheese sandwich would be prohibited to eat, and is the foundation for other important laws, such as [[#Waiting Between Meat and Dairy]] and [[#Joint Placement on a Table]]. 
##### General Contact:
If cold meat and dairy touched one another: if they were moist, they require [[Measurements#Surface Level|הדחה]] (see שו"ע צא:א), and if they were dry then nothing need be done because nothing transferred from one to the other (ש"ך שם בשם הב"ח), unless they were salted, in which case they would need הדחה (see רעק"א שם מביא מסע' ה).
### Meat:
Meat is the flesh of a living creature. As such, there are five categories of meat, respectively the flesh of a:
#### Domesticated Animal (בהמה):
In the context of בשר בחלב, only the meat of a kosher domesticated animal (בהמה טהורה) is prohibited מדאורייתא. When mentioned unqualified, this is what meat refers to. The meat of a non-kosher בהמה is addressed [[#^29cba1|here]].

##### Blood:
Blood, although it is [prohibited to be consumed](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.3.17?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he), is not included in the laws ofבשר בחלב ([:גמ' חולין קיג](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) and is therefore permitted to be cooked with milk and such a mixture is permitted to be benefitted from. (ש"ע פז:ו) ^918d9f

There is a debate whether cooked blood is (רמב"ם הל' מ"א ט:ו) or is not ([רש"י מנחות כא.](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=21&format=pdf)) included in the prohibition against consuming blood. According to those who permit cooked blood, blood *is* included in בשר בחלב מדרבנן. Therefore, everyone agrees that it's prohibited to consume blood cooked with milk, either because cooked blood is prohibited or because it is included in בשר בחלב מדרבנן.
##### Fetus (שליל):
A fetus found in a properly slaughtered domesticated animal is considered full-fledged meat and so has the same laws as a normal [[#Domesticated Animal (בהמה)|domesticated animal]]. 
##### Amniotic Sac (שליא):
an [amniotic sac](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amniotic%20sac) is excluded from the laws of בב"ח by the same exclusion as [[#^918d9f|blood]].
##### Quasi-Edible Parts:
The following is a list of animal parts that are only quasi-edible and are therefore not considered to be meat מדאורייתא, although מדרבנן they are still prohibited^[The ש"ך as interpreted by the פ"ת holds that this prohibition is just for eating, while others argue and say its even for cooking.] (שו"ע פז:ז):
* Skin^[Skin that is exceptionally soft, such as that of the fatty tail, might be considered full-fledged meat (פמ"ג, הובא בפ"ת ס' פז ס"ק טו).]
* Ligaments & Tendons
* Bones
* The soft roots of the horns 
* The soft roots of the hooves 

#### Undomesticated Animal (חיה):
The meat of a חיה is consistently grouped with that of [[#^60e550|birds]], and so shares their laws.

#### Bird (עוף):
Birds are permitted מדאורייתא to be eaten with milk, but are treated as meat מדרבנן and are therefore prohibited to be eaten with milk ([[#^28bf18|even of a חיה]]). As such, it is permitted to be cooked with milk and for the product of such cooking to be benefitted from. Whether such cooking is actually allowed in practice or is prohibited because of מראת עין is disputed by the (פ"ז ס"ק ה) ט"ז and the (שם ס"ק ז) ש"ך. The ט"ז says explicitly that it's prohibited, while the ש"ך says that [[בישול - Cooking#^abd781|there is no מראת עין]] by cooking at all, so obviously he would hold that to cook bird meat with milk is permitted.   ^60e550

Unless otherwise specified, when chicken is mentioned in these laws, all kosher birds are included, chicken is just a common example.

##### Eggs:
Eggs that have been laid are permitted to be combined with meat or milk. If they have not yet been laid and were found within a slaughtered chicken, whether they are considered part of the mother, and therefore forbidden to be combined with milk, or like laid eggs that can be combined with milk, depends on what stage of development they have reached.

###### The Development of Chicken Eggs Within the Mother:
Chickens that are in their egg-laying state (which they are now kept in permanently, by artificial means, so they produce eggs every day) have multiple eggs at various stages of development within them at a given time, each roughly a day ahead of the next. They start as yolks attached by a veiny membrane to the ovary where they grow. When the yolk has grown to full size, the membrane splits, releasing the yolk. The yolk then moves to the next stage where it is surrounded by the white, then a membrane, then the shell.

###### At What Stage of Development is an Egg Considered an Independent Entity:
The שו"ע (פז:ה) says that once the egg has a white, it is considered an independent entity and is permitted to be combined with milk. This would even be true in a scenario where, instead of splitting and releasing the yolk, the membrane detached and remained surrounding the yolk beneath the white. If the egg has not yet developed a white, it is considered meat and cannot be combined with milk. Eating such an egg (so long as the yolk is fully developed) does not, however, require the eater to wait before eating dairy.  The ש"ך (שם ס"ק יב) says this is true even if the veiny membrane is still on the yolk.

The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ו) says that the women have a custom to treat even a fully completed egg with a shell to be considered meat if it was found within a slaughtered chicken, and this custom should be followed. However, he says that if the egg was already combined with milk, as long as it has developed the membrane found beneath the shell. ^710fda

The ש"ך (שם ס"ק י) holds that even if the egg has developed the membrane around the white, it still cannot be combined with milk. However, if it has already been combined with milk the mixture is permitted to be eaten, so long as the egg has developed a white and the veiny membrane is not still around the yolk. That said, if prohibiting the mixture would result in a large financial loss, we can rely on those who hold that an egg is permitted to be combined with milk so long as the egg yolk has completely developed, even if it is surrounded by the veiny membrane.

He argues on the ט"ז, and says that as long as one is not in a place that explicitly follows the [[#^710fda|women's custom]], we are not bound by it.
#### Fish (דג):
Fish are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk (ש"ע פז:ג), but they are practically prohibited from being eaten with meat due to a סכנה (health risk) (ב"י או"ח סימן קע"ג).  ^c8139e

The ב"י adds (פז:ג) that there is also a סכנה when they are combined with milk. Because of this, many sects of ספרדים will not eat fish with milk either.  ^961f2e

The רמ"א says (דרכי משה שם ס"ק ד) that this ב"י must be due to a printing error, as the source that the ב"י quotes says fish and *meat*, not milk. ^0aaf36
#### Grasshopper (חגב):
Technically this category should be insects, but grasshoppers ([only certain species](https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/19/Q1/)) are the only kosher insects. Because this is the case, there is no halachic term (that I am aware of) that refers to insects and includes grasshoppers as well.

Grasshoppers are like [[#Fish (דג)|fish]] in that they are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk (ש"ע פז:ג), but differ from fish in that there is no סכנה concern associated with their combination with either meat or milk. 



### Milk: 
#### דאורייתא:
The only milk that is prohibited under the laws of בשר בחלב מדאורייתא is that of a kosher בהמה. There are milk derivatives, some retain their status of milk and so are included מדאורייתא, and some are considered to have lost their milk status.
##### Whey:
Whey is a by-product of the cheese-making process. Rennet is introduced to milk, which causes the formation of curds from the fat of the milk. Those curds are then removed and processed further into cheese. The "milk" left behind is called whey.

The ראש (הובא בטור פז:ח) says that whey retains its milk status and is forbidden to be combined with meat מדאורייתא. 
#### דרבנן:
##### חיה:
The milk of a kosher חיה is included in the laws of בשר בחלב מדרבנן (פ"ת ס' פז ס"ק ז). 

In fact, the milk of a חיה is even prohibited to be combined with the meat of a חיה  or bird (רמבם הל' מאכלות אסורות ט:ד).  ^28bf18

##### מי חלב:
The step below whey is מי חלב, which is whey that has been cooled off, so the remaining fat floats to the top, and then skimmed, leaving a thin watery substance. This substance is only prohibited to be combined with meat מדרבנן. (ראש הובא בטור פז:ח) 
##### חלב מתה:
The milk found in a dead animal, whether it was slaughtered properly or it died otherwise (ש"ך פז ס"ק יד), is not included in the prohibition of בשר בחלב מדאורייתא, but it is prohibited מדרבנן to be eaten with meat (ש"ע פז:ו) or cooked with meat (רמ"א בהגה שם). The reason it is not considered milk מדאורייתא is that the גמרא ([:חולין קיג](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) says that the פסוק says חלב אמו even though it could have just said חלב to exclude חלב מתה. The גמרא uses this same reasoning to exclude [[#Male Milk|male milk]] and [[#Milk of a Non-Kosher Animal|the milk of a non-kosher animal]]. ^91309e

##### Rennet:
Rennet is milk found in the belly of a nursing calf. It contains enzymes from the stomach lining which make it a crucial component of the cheesemaking process.

According to most opinions, when it is found congealed in the stomach it is not considered to be milk, rather it is considered a waste product. It can therefore be combined with meat (שו"ע פז:ט). The ש"ך (שם) adds that although congealed rennet is technically permitted to be combined with meat, one should not intentionally do so because of [[מראת עין#^6d2017|מראת עין]].

Even when the rennet is found in a fluid state, the מחבר says it is not milk, but cites an opinion that it *is* considered milk and cannot be combined with meat. The רמ"א concurs with this stringent opinion. (שו"ע שם)
###### Rennet In Cheesemaking:
Rennet that has sat in the stomach of the animal for 24 hours post-slaughter is considered to have been [[#Soaking (כבוש)|soaked]] with it and is therefore prohibited to be used to make cheese, as the בליעות of meat it absorbed from the stomach will be mixed in to the cheese. The same would apply if the stomach was salted before the rennet was removed. (שו"ע פז:י)

The רמ"א (שם) adds that one should not even allow the rennet to remain in the stomach long enough for the stomach to cool down to room temperature, but if one did wait that long the rennet is not prohibited.

If rennet that was left in the stomach for 24 hours was used to make cheese, the status of the cheese depends on the state of the rennet  (רמ"א שם):
1. **The Rennet Was Fluid:** If the rennet was fluid then the cheese is prohibited unless [[תערובות#ביטול בששים|the quantity of milk used to make it was 60 times greater than the quantity of rennet used.]] 
2. **The Rennet Was Found Congealed:** If the rennet was found congealed in the stomach it is considered waste and therefore even the meat flavor it absorbed is considered to be waste. Because of this, the cheese made with it is not prohibited.
3. **The Rennet Was Found As A Fluid But Later Congealed:** The primarily accepted opinion is to treat such rennet as fluid and therefore prohibit cheese made therewith. There are, however, opinions who treat such rennet as congealed, therefore in a case where prohibiting the cheese will constitute a significant loss we are lenient and permit the cheese.
##### Male Milk: 
The milk of a male animal that has a genetic abnormality which causes the animal to have udders (see [רשי חולין קיג: ד"ה ולא בחלב זכר](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) is [[#^91309e|not included in בשר בחלב מדאורייתא]]. However,  מדרבנן it is included in the prohibition. (ש"ע פז:ו)
#### מראת עין:
There are various "milks" that are prohibited due to מראת עין, however the specifics of that prohibition is different for each:

##### Almond Milk:
Almond milk, while not truly milk at all, has enough of an appearance of milk that the רמ"א (פז:ג) requires meat combined with almond milk to be served with almonds (or some other indicator) nearby to show that the "milk" is not truly milk. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ד) extends this to include chicken with almond milk, but he holds that if you don't have almonds, you can still eat the chicken (ב"ה שם ס"ק ו) or the meat (פ"ת שם ס"ק י). The ש"ך (שם ס"ק ו), however, disagrees with this ט"ז, based on a מהרש"ל, and holds that without an indicator it would be prohibited to eat even a mixture of *chicken* and almond milk. The פ"ת (שם) adds that chicken with almond milk would only require an indicator if it was served at a large meal, where there would be a real concern of מראת עין, but in a private setting an indicator would not be required. ^1697a8

R' Yitzchok Dov Lefkowitz told me in the name of R' Heinneman that since non-dairy "milks" have become so widespread, there is no longer an issue of מראת עין, because an observer that sees a mixture of meat and a milk alternative will assume that it's not real milk. Because of this, the Star-K allows restaurants under its supervision to serve non-dairy milk in an unmarked metal container, as opposed to their old policy of requiring the milk to be brought out in its original container that clearly says "almond milk."

##### Mother's Milk:
Human breast milk, while it is both a true milk and permitted to be consumed even by adults (once it has been separated from its source), is not included in the laws of בשר בחלב. However it is prohibited (at least with meat, see the discussion of [[#^1697a8|almond milk regarding combinations with chicken]]) under the laws of מראת עין and, unlike almond milk, there is no solution available of placing an indicator next to the dish. However such milk is nullified in a simple majority so long as it cannot be seen in the dish.  (שו"ע פז:ד)
###### Human Male Milk:
In the event of an abnormality which causes a man to produce milk, it would share the laws of mother's milk. (רמ"א פז:ו as explained by the ש"ך)

##### Milk of a Non-Kosher Animal:
The milk of a non-kosher animal is [[#^91309e|not prohibited under the laws of בשר בחלב to be combined with meat.]] Of course such a combination (or the reverse, non-kosher meat with kosher milk) is forbidden to be eaten, but that is just because the milk was already prohibited to be eaten as the milk of a non-kosher animal. It is, however, permitted to cook and benefit from such a mixture (שו"ע פז:ג). ^29cba1

The רמ"א (שם סעיף ד) says that it is forbidden to cook such a mixture because of מראת עין, although he does not extend this to chicken/non-kosher milk. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ה) considers the רמא's reasoning to be flawed but is hesitant to permit that which the רמא prohibits. The  ש"ך, on the other hand, [[בישול - Cooking#^abd781|holds that cooking cannot be prohibited as מראת עין at all]], so he disagrees with the רמ"א and permits such cooking.



## Laws:
### חתיכה עצמה נעשית נבילה (חענ"נ):
#### To Which Prohibitions Does חענ"נ Apply:
According to basic Torah law, when איסור is combined with היתר (such as נבילה falling into cholent), the resulting mixture is prohibited, so long as the איסור is not [[תערובות#ביטול בששים|בטל]]. It is important to note that the היתר itself does not become אסור, it just becomes inextricably linked with the איסור (flavor of the נבילה distributes throughout the cholent) so that it practically cannot be consumed without also consuming the איסור.

However, when meat and milk are cooked together, they each become prohibited intrinsically, not just due to the meat/milk present in the milk/meat. This is because both the meat and the milk are permitted substances, so if the mixture is declared prohibited, the components must necessarily become prohibited themselves. This concept is known as חתיכה עצמה נעשית נבילה (חענ"נ), (lit. the piece itself becomes נבילה, i.e. intrinsically prohibited) (שו"ע צב:ג-ד).

There is a major dispute amongst the ראשנים whether there is a דרבנן extension of חענ"נ from בב"ח to all other prohibitions. The ב"י (שם) rules that there is no such extension and the רמ"א (see שם סע' ד) (and therefore this work, as it is written from an Ashkenazic perspective) rules that there is. ^bec037

#### The Ramifications of חענ"נ:
The primary consequence of חענ"נ occurs when the prohibited mixture (a cholent containing נבילה meat) itself is mixed into a larger permitted dish (a chicken soup, for example). Without חענ"נ, the larger dish need only contain 60 times the original איסור, and in fact the permitted component can be counted towards that 60 (the soup and the cholent together need to be 60 times the נבילה). *With* חענ"נ, the permitted component of the original mixture becomes intrinsically prohibited, requiring the second permitted dish to be 60 times the entire first mixture, not just the original איסור (the soup must be 60 times large than the entire cholent, not just the נבילה) (שו"ע צב:ד).


### Secondary Flavor Transfer (נותן טעם בר נותן טעם):
We know that food cooked in a utensil [[תערובות#^2d098f|transfers its flavor into the utensil]], that [[תערובות#^4c4a72|food subsequently cooked in that utensil receives that flavor from the utensil]], and that [[תערובות#^10325d|the flavor being present is as if the food it came from is present]]. Therefore, if one cooks meat in a pot and then cooks dairy in that pot ([[תערובות#בן יומו|within 24 hours]], see רמ"א צה:ב), even if the pot is clean, the dairy will receive flavor of meat and be prohibited as בב"ח [[תערובות#^09539d|unless the dairy has a volume that is 60 times that of the meat flavor that was contained within the walls of the pot]]^[Assuming one knows what volume of meat was absorbed in the walls, such as if one cooked a known quantity of meat in the pot, then the walls can't contain more than that quantity of meat. If one doesn't know the volume of the meat flavor in the walls, he must calculate the necessary 60 against the full volume of the walls of the pot (which, in this particular case, means ביטול is virtually impossible, as the dairy contents of the pot can only be 60 times the volume of the walls in a pot that is exceptionally wide with vanishingly thin walls, see ב"י ס' צג) (ט"ז ס' צה ס"ק ו).].

Such a scenario would be called a prohibited secondary flavor transfer (נותן טעם בר נותן טעם דאיסורא): a primary flavor transfer from the meat to the pot and a secondary transfer of that same flavor from the pot to the dairy, which results in a prohibition, i.e. בב"ח.  ^528e1c

There is a special law that in the event of a *permitted* secondary flavor transfer (נותן טעם בר נותן טעם דהתירא), like the above case but with fish instead of dairy (Meat>Pot>Fish), the meat flavor is considered to have been weakened to the point of exclusion from [[תערובות#^10325d|טעם כעיקר]] (as far as [[#^ba43d4|לא תבשל]] is concerned, see [[#^4ae44f|below]]) and the fish can therefore be eaten with dairy^[And the fish itself can be eaten, [[#^0aaf36|according to the רמ"א]] even though it would be [[#^c8139e|prohibited due to סכנה had it absorbed the flavor directly from the meat]].]^[At least as far as the laws of בב"ח. [[#^961f2e|According to the מחבר himself, any combination of fish and dairy is practically prohibited due to סכנה]].], even though the fish would not be permitted to eat with dairy had it absorbed the same quantity of flavor directly from the meat, such as if the pot wasn't cleaned well^[Meaning if one *knows* that the pot wasn't cleaned well. If he doesn't know either way, he can assume that it was clean (ש"ך ס' צה ס"ק א).] and there was meat residue in the pot amounting to more than 1/60 of the fish (שו"ע צה:א).

The reason for this is that we consider each time the flavor transfers to weaken it somewhat, and two such weakenings are enough to exclude the flavor from [[תערובות#^10325d|טעם כעיקר]] as far as [[#^ba43d4|לא תבשל]] is concerned, because flavors that have transferred twice are not considered a normal part of cooking^[The (פ"מ (מש"ז צה:א writes that this is only true if the order is specifically into a utensil and then into food (Meat>Pot>Fish>Dairy), but the other way around (Meat>Fish>Pot>Dairy) would not create נב"נ because we say טעם כעיקר in food until it gets weakened by transferring into a כלי.]. If the second transfer is creating בב"ח (Meat>Pot>Dairy), then at the point when it mixes with the dairy it has not yet fully transferred twice, and is therefore still considered a normal part of cooking and can create בב"ח. ^4ae44f

This whole concept only applies to laws of בב"ח, and only before the meat and dairy have combined to become בב"ח. When we are dealing with other prohibitions, such as נבילה ^[an animal that died without being slaughtered properly, which is prohibited to be eaten מדאורייתא.] or בב"ח that has already become prohibited, there is no concept of weakening, because prohibitions like נבילה don't need to meet the standard of being a normal part of cooking, they just need to be present and detectable (שך ס' צד ס"ק כב). ^4b5e9a

#### Which Methods of Transfer Effect נב"נ:
As we saw above, the שו"ע (צה:א) holds that נב"נ applies no matter how the flavor transfers are effected.

The רמ"א (שם סע' ב) cites an opinion that when both of the flavor transfers are accomplished by [[#^d7444c|cooking]] or [[#^dbe714|roasting]], such as in the above case of Meat>Pot>Fish, we would not consider it נב"נ, because such methods of transfer have enough "power", as it were, to transfer flavor without diminishing it to the point of נב"נ. 

According to the these opinions, we would only say נב"נ when the second transfer was the lesser level of placing יד סולדת fish on a cold plate that had previously absorbed בליעות from meat (Meat>Plate>Fish), or vice versa if the fish was cold and the plate was hot (ט"ז שם ס"ק ג).

The רמ"א (שם) rules that we should be stringent like this opinion initially (לכתחילה), and therefore, in a case of Meat>Pot>Fish for example, not combine the fish with dairy^[Even according to the שו"ע, one  would not be permitted to cook the fish in the meat pot with the intention of eating it with dairy, they only argue once the נב"נ transfer has happened whether you can eat the fish with dairy (ש"ך ס' צה ס"ק ג).], but that if one already combined the fish with dairy (fried it in butter, for example) one is allowed to eat it (בדיעבד)^[Only if the one of the transfers was cooking (in water), because then the water acts as a kind of third flavor transfer (ex. if the meat was cooked in the pot: Meat>Water>Pot>Fish). If both transfers were effected by roasting, then we are stringent like these opinions even בדיעבד. Therefore, in a case where the meat was roasted and the fish was cooked (Meat>Pot>Water>Fish), the water of the cooking would itself be prohibited to combine with milk, because it will have absorbed the meat flavor directly from the pot, like roasting (פ"ת ס' צה ס"ק ב).]. In a case of Meat>Plate>Fish, one could even combine the fish with dairy לכתחילה, because even the stringent opinion cited by the רמ"א agrees that such a case is נב"נ^[Although one cannot cause such a transfer of putting hot fish on a meat plate if he's planning on eating the fish with dairy (ט"ז ס' צה ס"ק ד)]. ^aa5ed4

This stringency would only apply to eating the fish with dairy, but even the stringent opinion would agree that to place נב"נ fish (Meat>Pot>Fish) on a dairy plate would be permitted.
#### Sharp Foods:
Sharp foods are an exception to נב"נ, as their sharpness allows them to more powerfully draw the בליעת from their source (the pot, or the grinder, in a case of spices that were ground with a grinder that contains meat בליעות), effecting the transfer without weakening the בליעות, even if [[תערובות#Reinvigorating the איסור (מכליא לשבח)|the pot or grinder are not בני יומן]], therefore, if the sharp food or spices fall into dairy, the mixture must contain 60 times the sharp food or spices^[The reason we only need 60 times the spices, even though spices are not normally בטל in 60 because their flavor is still detectable at far greater ratios, is because the spices are not intrinsically prohibited when combined with dairy, only the meat flavor they contain, which is בטל in 60 (ש"ך ס' צה ס"ק ח)] in order to be permitted (רמ"א צה:ב).
#### Washing Dishes:
If one washes a meat utensil and a dairy utensil (both of which are [[תערובות#בן יומו|בני יומן]]^[Meaning he *knows* that they're בני יומן. If he's unsure, then we can assume they were not בני יומן and permit them, even according to the [[#^77f048|רמ"א]] (רעק"א ס' צה ד"ה וכמו)]) in a basin with [[תערובות#יד סולדת|יד סולדת]] water, as long as neither of the utensils have any food residue of meat or dairy on them, they are both permitted, because any flavor transfer between them is נב"נ (Meat/Dairy>Utensil>Water>Utensil) .  However, if there was residue of meat or dairy on one of the utensils, both utensils are prohibited (unless the water is 60 times the residue), because the residue of, say, meat will prohibit the dairy utensil (Meat>Water>Dairy Utensil), which will then in turn emit בליעות of בב"ח^[Which, being איסור, are [[#^4b5e9a|not subject to נב"נ]].] which will enter the meat utensil and render it prohibited as well (שו"ע שם סע' ג).

The רמ"א (שם) argues, and rules that both utensils are prohibited, even in a case where both of them are clean (assuming they are both בני יומן). The reason is either that we are worried that the utensils will make direct contact and flavor will transfer from one to the other and be [[#^528e1c|נב"נ דאיסורא]] (Meat/Dairy>Utensil>Utensil(containing Dairy/Meat)), or that we are worried that the meat and dairy בליעות will combine immediately in the water, rendering the water אסור, which in turn makes the utensils אסור (ט"ז שם ס"ק ח). ^77f048

The רמ"א adds that we only prohibit the utensils if they were washed simultaneously and in a [[בישול - Cooking#כלי ראשון|כלי ראשון]], but if they were washed sequentially (meaning they were never in the water at the same time), or the hot water in the basin was a [[בישול - Cooking#כלי שני|כלי שני]], they would be permitted, because:
* If they weren't in the water at the same time, the two utensils can never make direct contact, and the meat/milk flavor emitted from the first utensil will have come to rest in the water as נב"נ by the time the second utensil is placed in the water, therefore even if the meat/milk flavor then mingles with the milk/meat flavor emitted by the second utensil, the flavors won't combine to create a prohibition.
* If the water was a כלי שני, then, being that we rule like the opinion that a כלי שני does not have the ability to transfer בליעות, the water can't draw the meat and milk flavor out of, or impart flavor into, the utensils in order to create איסור. This would even be true if the utensils were dirty, the כלי שני has no ability to cause the בליעות to move, and so this is no worse than combining cold meat and milk together (ט"ז שם ס"ק יב).

Even according to the שו"ע, one should not wash meat and milk dishes together לכתחילה, even if they are not בני יומן, because both [[#^aa5ed4|נב"נ]] (see footnote) and [[תערובות#נותן טעם לפגם|נט"ל]] are only permitted בדיעבד.

If a dairy utensil was found amongst meat utensils (or vice versa), we are not concerned that they may have been washed together in a way that would prohibit the dairy utensil, and it is therefore permitted (רמ"א שם).

##### Ashes (Dish Soap):
In a case of washing a meat utensil and dairy utensil together, if one added ashes to the water before adding the utensils, the utensils do not become prohibited, because the ashes render the water, and any בליעות they subsequently absorb from the utensils, [[תערובות#נותן טעם לפגם|נט"ל]] (the same would apply nowadays to dish soap, R' Lefkowitz) (שו"ע שם ס"ק ד).

The ט"ז (שם ס"ק טו) and ש"ך (שם ס"ק כא) both argue on this ruling:
+ the ט"ז shows that the רמ"א must argue from his [[#^896d30|ruling]] prohibiting using a shampoo pot for cooking food, even though that pot is used to cook shampoo which contains ashes and should therefore be permitted because of נט"ל. He additionally found a מהרש"ל בשם מהרי"ל that, in a scenario where a minor reported that soap made from ashes and prohibited fats (חֵלֶב) fell into a pot of food, ruled that the pot is permitted because we do not believe the minor's report. The implication of the ruling is that were we to believe the report, the food would be prohibited, even though the soap contained ash and therefore should have been considered נט"ל according to the שו"ע.
+ The ש"ך asks from a תוס in חולין (ק. ד"ה בשקדם) that is discussing the following: when the Jews defeated the Midianites and plundered their belongings, they were commanded to purify the Midianite's utensils through [[תיקון כלים#הגעלה|הגעלה]]. The issue תוס is discussing is how they could have done הגעלה to the largest utensil (that therefore could not be placed inside a larger utensil), the water of the הגעלה would not have been 60 times the flavor that would leave the walls (because it is nearly impossible to have a utensil whose contents are 60 times greater that the volume of its walls), and therefore the flavor would be able to reenter the walls and prohibit the anew. The question of the ש"ך is: if this method of the שו"ע works, why didn't תוס simply explain that they added ashes to the הגעלה water, rendering any flavor that emerges נט"ל and unable to re-prohibit the pot?

The פ"ת (שם ס"ק ו) answers for the שו"ע that ash does not have the ability to render prohibited flavor נט"ל and therefore inert. What it *can* do is prevent meat and milk from becoming בב"ח to begin with, because the formation of בב"ח needs to be by means of a normal cooking process (דרך בישול), and cooking with ash does not qualify as such. All of the questions are therefore resolved, because the issues under discussion in every case brought by the ט"ז and ש"ך are dealing with fully formed איסור:
+ The reason the רמ"א prohibits the use of a shampoo pot for cooking food is that the ashes used for the shampoo come from beneath the stove, where hot drippings of meat and milk mingle, become בב"ח, and then get added with the ashes to the pot. Now, by the time the drippings are added to the pot along with the ashes, they have already become prohibited as בב"ח, so the ashes can't render them inert as נט"ל.
+ Similarly, the soap in the מהרש"ל's case was made with חֵלֶב, which is an איסור, so the ashes don't help to make נט"ל.
+ In the case of the Midianite pots as well, the issue with the pots is that they were presumably used to cook improperly slaughtered animals (נבילות), animals with terminal injuries or diseases (טריפות), or non-kosher animals (such as pigs), all of which are אסור, so the ashes wouldn't help to render them נט"ל.

##### Pouring Hot Water (עירוי):
If one pours water from a [[בישול - Cooking#כלי ראשון|כלי ראשון]] that contains בן יומו meat flavor onto a utensil that contains בן יומו dairy flavor, the utensil that was poured on is prohibited, because we consider water poured from a כלי ראשון (referred to as עירוי מכלי ראשון) to have a similar capacity to cook as water that is still within a כלי ראשון (though not exactly the same, see [[#^0cbf1e|below]]), so the meat flavor transfers from the upper utensil, through the uninterrupted stream of hot water, into the lower utensil^[The reason this is not נב"נ (Meat>Utensil>Water>Dairy Utensil) is that we treat עירוי (as far as the lower utensil is concerned, the flavor only transfers one-way) as if the stream is inside the upper utensil, and in the equivalent case where the dairy utensil is inside the meat utensil, [[^77f048|it would be prohibited]] (ט"ז ס' צה ס"ק יג)] (רמ"א צה:ג).

The רמ"א continues that if one poured from a neutral (parve) כלי ראשון onto a meat utensil and a dairy utensil simultaneously, even if they both still have residue of meat/dairy on them, they would not be prohibited, because עירוי is not actually a כלי ראשון, we just treat it the same in certain situations. ^0cbf1e

The ש"ך (שם ס"ק כ) finds the above opinion of the רמ"א difficult, because it is established law that עירוי cooks [[Measurements#כדי קליפה|כדי קליפה]], which should mean that the meat/dairy residue should have their flavor transferred into the outer קליפה of the dairy/meat utensils, rendering that layer prohibited. The רמ"א's opinion must therefore be that although we know that עירוי cooks כדי קליפה by chicken, that's only by chicken (or similar materials) which is soft and therefore transfers easily, but for utensils, which are hard, עירוי would only be able to either absorb or impart flavor, not both, which is what is required to create a prohibition here (the water needs to absorb flavor from the meat/dairy residue and then impart that flavor to the utensil).

The ש"ך doesn't agree with this distinction, and therefore rules:
+ If both utensils have residue on them, both utensils will be prohibited כדי קליפה.
+ If only one utensil has residue on it, the utensil without residue will be prohibited כדי קליפה (the residue of meat will be absorbed into the water and imparted into the dairy pot), and even the pot with the residue will be prohibited except where this will result in a major loss (הפסד מרובה) (because we are worried that the water will extract the בב"ח flavor from the now-prohibited dairy utensil and impart it into the meat utensil, although this is not a strong enough possibility to prohibit in a case of major loss).
+ If they were both clean, they are permitted because any flavor transfer will be נב"נ (Meat>Utensil>Water>Utensil).
+ If they were both clean, but one utensil already contained איסור, the flavor will be transferred from the אסור utensil and prohibit it, and נב"נ won't help because we don't say נב"נ by איסור.^[There is no permit of הפסד מרובה here, unlike the dirty utensil when only one has residue, because here the עירוי only needs to absorb flavor from one place (the אסור utensil) and impart it somewhere else (the permitted utensil), as opposed to over there where the flavor needs to be absorbed from the meat residue, imparted to the dairy utensil, further absorbed from the now-בב"ח utensil, and imparted into the meat utensil.]

##### The Status of the Water:
Even if the utensils are not בני יומן, the wash water will still be prohibited לכתחילה, although if they are combined with food that would be a case of בדיעבד and therefore permitted. This is because [[תערובות#נותן טעם לפגם|נט"ל]] is אסור לכתחילה, and the only reason to permit the water is the fact that the בליעות of meat and milk it contains are not בני יומן, therefore the water is only permitted in a בדיעבד scenario^[One could ask, isn't every case where the water has absorbed these בליעות a בדיעבד scenario, the water has already absorbed the בליעות? The answer is that water alone is never considered to be a case of בדיעבד, because it's no real loss to just spill out the water and replace it (obviously in a drought or other scenario where water is scarce/valuable this would not be true), and the permit of בדיעבד only exists because "the Torah has mercy on the money of Jews" (ט"ז ס' צה ס"ק י).] (רמ"א צה:ג).
### Dehydrated Meat:

One of the methods used to make cheese is to place a piece of the stomach in the milk, so that the stomach enzymes cause the milk to curdle. This would normally be prohibited as the combination of meat (the stomach) and milk, and if the resulting cheese contains a detectable flavor of meat, the cheese would be prohibited (שו"ע פז:יא).^[The reason the meat is able to be nullified even though it is a [[תערובות#מעמיד|מעמיד]] is that the stomach is not [[תערובות#^76ef63|intrinsically prohibited, it's just its combination with milk that is prohibited.]]]

The רמ"א ( פז:י) proposes a solution to this problem wherein one could dehydrate the stomach until it is so dry that it's "like wood and has no moisture of meat." Such flesh can be used to make cheese, as the dry enzymes will still have an effect but there will be no flavor of meat transferred into the milk.

The ש"ך (שם ס"ק לג) argues on the רמ"א and says that one may not intentionally do use dehydrated stomach to curdle cheese, although he agrees that if it was used the resulting cheese would be permitted.

He adds that the same dehydration process would also remove the ability to impart flavor from the other intestines.

### Safeguards Against Cooking:
#### The Stringencies of the רמ"א:

The רמ"א in פז:ו lists four stringencies that one should keep to avoid the inadvertent transgression of the laws of בשר בחלב:
1. One should not stoke the flame upon which a non-Jew's pot is cooking, because even if there is not currently meat *and* milk in the pot, the pot might have recently been used to cook meat or milk and now be cooking the opposite, which would be considered cooking בשר בחלב, due to the current meat mixing with the [[תערובות#בליעות & טעם כעיקר|בליעות]] of the milk (or vice versa) that were previously in the pot.^[the reason this is only a stringency and not an actual prohibition is that we have a rule that [[תערובות#סתם כלים אינם בני יומן|סתם כלים אינם בני יומן]], and so the non-jews utensil presumably was not used within the last 24 hours to cook meat/milk (or anything else).]   
2. One should not combine wash-water that has been used to clean meat pots with wash-water that has been used to clean dairy pots, even to give to his animal, "because such a mixture is prohibited to benefit from."^[This statement is puzzling, because, as the ש"ך points out, what would the prohibition be? The ש"ך therefore concludes that the case is where the waters were combined hot, and they are therefore true בשר בחלב. This is also problematic because, as רעק"ע points out, it would be forbidden to make such a combination to begin with, as that would be cooking בשר בחלב. Furthermore, if it becomes actual בשר בחלב, how can the רמ"א conclude that it is just a stringency not to feed the water to one's animals, it is an איסור דאורייתא of benefitting from בשר בחלב? Perhaps the רמ"א means that such a mixture would be prohibited from benefit if it were hot and so says even such a mixture when cold should be avoided, which would explain why it's just a stringency and not a prohibition.]
3.  A pot used for making shampoo (the primary ingredient of which was ash at the time) should not be used to cook food, because the ashes used in the shampoo would be taken from the stove and so would contain drippings of meat and of milk from previous cooking, meaning that בליעות of בב"ח are contained in the pot.^[The reason this is just a stringency is presumably סתם כלים אינם בני יומן.] ^896d30
4. The furnaces used to heat the houses in Europe in the רמ"א's time would have a built-in pot for boiling water (not for food purposes). Pots of food would be placed in the furnace to cook, and the food would occasionally splash onto the walls of the built-in pot. Now, they would cook both meat and milk (not simultaneously) in these furnaces, which means that the built-in pot would contain בליעות of both. Therefore, the built-in pots should not be used for cooking food.^[This as well is presumably due to סתם כלים אינם בני יומן. The ש"ך (שם ס"ק כא) adds that if the built-in pot is made of metal it can be cooked in even according to the רמ"א because it's constantly being heated to the point of [[תיקון כלים#ליבון קל|ליבון קל]] by the normal firing of the furnace.]

### Safeguards Against Combination:

#### Joint Placement on a Table:
It is prohibited to place meat, even of [[#^60e550|birds]] or [[#Undomesticated Animal (חיה)|undomesticated animals]], on a table upon which someone is eating dairy, due to the concern that [[#^5033f6|the one eating meat may eat some of the other's dairy over the course of the meal or vice versa]] (שו"ע פח). This law was enacted against the possibility of one casually and unthinkingly eating the other's food. With that in mind, there are a few conditions for this law, without which casual and unthinking eating of the other's food would be unlikely:

1. The two people must have a basic level of familiarity with each other.. ^[The accepted opinion (שם ט"ז ס"ק ב וש"ך ס"ק ד) is that this even holds true if the two people have an animosity which would cause them not to share, because we don't want to make the law nuanced, which could lead to mistakes.]
2. The table is the one where the *eating* is taking place, this prohibition doesn't apply to a serving table.
3. The two are sitting near enough that one can reach the other's food (פ"ת שם ס"ק ג בשם ב"ח בשם רש"ל).
4. There is nothing placed between the two of them to serve as a reminder not to eat the other's food. ^[A third-party watcher would not fulfill this requirement (רעק"א שם), the reminder must be an object that serves as a constant reminder directly to the eaters.]
##### What Qualifies as a Reminder:
As the purpose of the item being placed on the table is to be a constant reminder to those eating not to partake of the other's food, the item must be something that will continually be noticed due to the irregularity of its presence. This precludes any item that would have been on the table even had they both been eating meat or milk, such as a candelabra at night.

###### Separate Tablecloths:
If the two parties are eating on separate tablecloths or on separate placemats (as long as they are not accustomed to using placemats, psak from R' Tzvi Yaakov Stein), that would qualify as a reminder.
###### Bread:
A loaf of bread placed between the two parties qualifies as a reminder (שו"ע פח:ב) but only if the two of them are not eating from that loaf (רמ"א שם). 

The רמ"א adds that although this is true, in our scenario of two people, one eating meat and the other eating dairy, they shouldn't actually eat from the same loaf because of bits of food that can adhere to the loaf.^[This would presumably not hold true if the loaf was sliced, but I don't have any proof of this.]

###### A Shared Cup:
If a cup that would not normally be on the table even if it was in use, then even if they are both drinking from it it would would qualify as a reminder (רמ"א שם).

The רמ"א adds that although this is true, in our scenario of two people, one eating meat and the other eating dairy, they shouldn't actually drink from the same cup because of bits of food that can adhere to the cup. Similarly, they should each have their own salt dish.^[This probably wouldn't apply if they use a covered saltshaker like is normal nowadays, as opposed to dipping plates where meat or dairy may fall in, but I again have no proof of this.]



#### Waiting Between Meat and Dairy:
##### Dairy After Meat:
One may not eat dairy immediately after eating meat, even of [[#Bird (עוף)|birds]] or [[#Undomesticated Animal (חיה)|undomesticated animals]] (שו"ע פט:א). This is because we are worried that the dairy will mix with the meat that was previously eaten, either because meat leaves a lingering taste in the throat when swallowed ([רשי  חולין ק"ה. ד"ה אסור ](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=105&format=pdf)) or because bits of meat get stuck in between the eater's teeth (רמב"ם הל' מ"א ט, כח).  ^24c9c9

We rule stringently to take both opinions into account, therefore one must wait even if one chewed food without swallowing (even though, according to רשי, the waiting period is only triggered by swallowing); if one found meat between his teeth after the waiting period he must remove it^[Finding such meat does not extend the waiting period, it continues from the time of the original eating (ש"ך ס' פט ס"ק ג), but the finder must [[#Cleansing the Palate (קינוח)|cleanse his palate]] (רמ"א שם סע' א) and rinse his mouth (ש"ך שם ס"ק ד)before eating dairy.] (even though, according to the רמב"ם, any meat remaining between the teeth after the waiting period is no longer considered meat and need not be removed^[This is because the רמב"ם holds that the source for the waiting period is the verse הבשר עודנו בין שיניהם (במדבר יא:לג) (lit. The meat was still between their teeth) which by, virtue of referring to particles of meat stuck between the teeth as meat, teaches us that such particles are considered meat, and even so, the רבנן said that after the waiting period, one can eat dairy, meaning that we no longer consider the particles between the teeth to be meat.]); and one must wait after eating fat like after meat^[Even though it doesn't stick in the teeth.] (see רמ"א פט:ג).

###### Length of the Waiting Period:
The source for waiting between meat and dairy is a גמרא ([חולין ק"ה](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=105&format=pdf)) that prohibits eating dairy after meat in the same meal but allows dairy "in a different meal."

The שו"ע (פט:א) interprets this as requiring one to wait the standard length of time between two meals, which in the time of the גמרא was six hours^[The hours referred to here are standard hours (60 minutes) not proportional hours (1/12 of the day or night).], before eating dairy after meat.

The רמ"א (שם) brings another opinion that interprets the גמרא completely differently. According to this interpretation, when the גמרא prohibits dairy after meat until "the next meal" it means that literally, so that all one would need to do is finish the current meal, say a ברכה אחרונה^[The רמ"א brings an opinion that one shouldn't make a ברכה אחרנה during his meal in order to eat dairy, but rules that we don't need to follow this opinion. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ג) vehemently argues on this רמ"א because the thing that makes one allowed to eat dairy is the fact that it's being eaten during a separate meal. It can't be considered a separate meal if one is eating continuously, stopping only to make a ברכה אחרנה. The ברכה אחרנה would only help if the first meal had been legitimately concluded (such as by davening mincha, like many do on shabbos to eat shaleshudos). The ט"ז goes so far as to say that "one who fears the word of G-d should avoid sitting at the same meal with those who are not scrupulous in this matter"], and start a new meal of dairy.^[According to this opinion, if he didn't make a ברכה אחרנה, then so long as the meal during which he ate meat can still be considered ongoing, he cannot eat dairy, even after six hours pass. (ש"ך ס' פט ס"ק ה)] According to this opinion he would also need to [[#Cleansing the Palate (קינוח)|cleanse his palate]] and rinse his mouth^[The order is not important, rinsing first would also be effective (ש"ך שם ס"ק טו).] before eating dairy.^806c6e

The רמ"א then brings the custom of his region which was to wait an hour between meat and dairy as a sort of compromise position between the two interpretations. Those following this custom are required to adhere to the stringencies of the רמ"א's first [[#^806c6e|opinion]], namely to make a ברכה אחרונה and cleanse the palate.

The רמ"א ends off that there are those that are "fastidious" to wait six hours, and that this is the proper thing to do. 

If one just chewed meat without swallowing, there's no need to be stringent and wait six hours instead of one. This is because [[#^24c9c9|according to רשי]] there is *no* waiting period required in such a situation, as the lingering flavor he considers the basis of the waiting requirement lingers in the *throat* and is therefore only triggered by *swallowing* meat, so  in this case one can rely on the combination of רשי who would require no waiting and those who generally only require an hour (רעק"א שם). Presumably he would apply this same logic to one who ate fat, because fat doesn't stick in the teeth and so would not trigger any waiting period according to the רמב"ם.

###### Cleansing the Palate (קינוח):
In order to remove flavor from one's mouth, one must do קינוח (lit. wiping), which we will refer to as cleansing the palate. It is accomplished by eating something that will scrape his mouth somewhat, like bread or a cracker, but not with something sticky, like flour, dates, or vegetables, as they don't work well for this purpose (שו"ע פט:ב). The food must be swallowed, not just chewed (פ"ת שם ס"ק ה).


##### Meat After Dairy:
Unlike [[#Dairy After Meat|eating dairy after meat]], there is no waiting period to eat meat after eating dairy (שו"ע פט:ב). This is because the two reasons that are given for the post-meat waiting period, namely lingering flavor and pieces stuck between the teeth, do not apply to dairy, which doesn't stick in the teeth or leave a lingering flavor. Therefore, one who eats dairy and wants to eat meat need only check his hands for dairy residue^[The פמ"ג (הובא בפ"ת שם ס"ק ד) and the ר"פ and עט"ז (הובא בב"ה שם ס"ק ה) say that unless one doesn't have water, he should be stringent to wash his hands even by day when there is amplel light, unless he is eating with utensils, in which case he doesn't need to wash his hands (פ"ח הובא בב"ה הנ"ל).] (or, at night when there's not enough light^[If one had access to a good light (such as modern electric lights) then he can just check his hands, like by day (ש"ך שם ס"ק ט).], wash them^[With water, not other liquids (ש"ך הובא בב"ה שם ס"ק ו)]), [[#Cleansing the Palate (קינוח)|cleanse his palate]], and rinse his mouth. Even this is only necessary for the meat of a domesticated^[because it is included in בב"ח מדארייתא so we treat it more stringently.] or non-domesticated^[because it is visually similar to the meat of a domesticated animal, even though its only included in בב"ח מדרבנן (ש"ך שם ס"ק יד).] animal, bird meat can be eaten immediately^[because it is only included in בב"ח מדרבנן and is not very similar to a domesticated animal.].

The רמ"א (שם) cites a stringent opinion that requires waiting for the same period as that of [[#Length of the Waiting Period|meat to dairy]] even from dairy to meat (even the meat of birds). He then rules that one should be stringent like this opinion when eating [[#What Qualifies as Hard Cheese|hard cheese]], because it can get stuck between the teeth and it has a strong flavor that lingers, but there are opinions who are lenient and so we should not protest those who don't wait even after hard cheese.

The זוהר (הובא בב"י או"ח קעג:ב ד"ה ואם הוא) describes the terrible spiritual harms that befall one who eats meat and milk "together, in the same hour^[although the word used can be translated as "in the same time period", implying less than an hour], or in the same meal." Because of this, there are those who are stringent to wait an hour between dairy and meat. Those who wait half an hour are presumably combining this with the principle of רובו ככולו (a majority is akin to the whole) to say that waiting just over half an hour is effectively the same as waiting an hour.

The שו"ע (פט:ד) continues that in order to eat meat after dairy on the same table where he ate the dairy (or vice versa^[this was presumably discussed in a case of meat after dairy because there is [[#Meat After Dairy|no/a limited waiting period]] after dairy, so it's more likely that one will want to use the same table before it has been cleaned.], see  רמ"א שם) he must clear away all of the remnants of bread on table and must change the tablecloth. The פ"ת (שם ס"ק ח) says that nowadays that we eat from plates, rather than directly off of the tablecloth, we can flip the tablecloth rather than change it.

###### What Qualifies as Hard Cheese:
The ש"ך (שם) says that any cheese that has been aged six months is considered hard. This is the generally accepted practice of those who wait after hard cheese.

The ט"ז (שם) says that only wormy cheese (such as [Casu Martzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_martzu)) or cheese that has been curdled with [[#Rennet|rennet]] (see פ"מ מ"ז שם ס"ק ד) has the lingering taste required to be considered hard cheese.

###### Do Waiters Need to Wash Their Hands:
The רמ"א (פט:ג) says, based on a רשי, that the requirement to wash one's hands between meat and dairy only applies to those who are eating, not waiters who just serve the food.

The ש"ך (שם) vehemently argues on the רמ"א and says that there is no difference between the waiters and the diners, and so waiters that touch meat must wash their hands before touching dairy and vice versa, and that the רשי cited by the רמ"א is saying that the waiter doesn't need to wash their hands before handling bread, nothing to do with בב"ח.
 


##### Dishes Containing Meat or Dairy (תבשיל של בשר או חלב):
If one eats a dish that contains meat (such as cholent) but doesn't eat any of the meat itself (he ate only the potatoes^[If he rinsed them, otherwise he must assume that there was liquefied fat present on the potato.]), he can immediately eat an equivalent dairy dish (Ex. the onions out of a French onion soup), or vice versa, with no need to wash his hands (although it is recommended) (שו"ע פט:ג). The רמ"א (שם) says that one must wash his hands between.

If after eating such a meat dish one wants to eat actual dairy, or vice versa, he must wash his hands in between (שו"ע שם). The רמ"א (שם) says that the custom has become not to eat actual dairy even after a meat dish just like [[#Waiting Between Meat and Dairy|after full-fledged meat]]. רעק"א (שם) says that by his time the custom had become to wait after a meat dish to eat a dairy dish as if between meat and dairy.

The רמ"א continues that after a dairy dish one would be permitted to eat meat right away, but he must wash his hands, even from a dairy dish to a meat dish. One would also be permitted to eat dairy immediately after a parve (neither meat nor dairy) dish cooked in a pot that had previously been used for meat^[Even if the pot was not cleaned well. We can derive this from the fact that the רמ"א permits eating dairy immediatley *after* the dish, not *with* the dish, which means there must be at least a small amount of meat present, otherwise the dish should be able to be eaten directly with the cheese (ש"ך שם ס"ק יט).].



#### Utensils of Meat and Dairy:
One cannot use a knife that is set aside for meat to cut dairy (שו"ע פט:ד), or vice versa (רמ"א שם). In fact, it is even prohibited to cut *bread* that is to be eaten with dairy/meat using a meat/dairy knife. This prohibition is only against initially cutting dairy with a meat knife, but if one already cut the dairy it is not prohibited unless the knife had been used to cut [[תערובות#יד סולדת|boiling hot meat]] [[תערובות#בן יומו|within the last 24 hours]] and the dairy is itself boiling hot.

##### Removing Meat or Dairy Status From a Utensil:
![[תיקון כלים#הסרת בליעות]]
###### Metal Knives:
Metal knives have an extra method of having their meat/dairy status removed, and that is to stab them repeatedly into hard earth (נעיצה בקרקע). That said, this method is not ideal, and the custom has become to have separate knives for dairy and meat, respectively, and to mark^[These marks were seemingly things like notches or other marks that are not clear in and of themselves that they were marking the knife as dairy, which is why the רמ"א says not to differ from the custom to mark the dairy knives specifically, as marking the meat knives instead would lead others assume that the meat knives were, in fact, dairy.] the dairy knives^[Nowadays that we use stickers that say חלבי and בשרי or knives with blue and red handles, it seems that there would be no reason to mark the dairy knives specifically, as our method of marking is unambiguous and a meat knife so marked will be obviously meat to an observer.], and one should not differ from the custom^[According to this, it would presumably be, at least, discouraged nowadays to have a red knife for dairy or a blue knife for meat, as any outsider using the kitchen would think the red is meat and the blue is dairy.] (רמ"א פט:ד). The ש"ך (שם) adds that although this is true, in an extenuating circumstance wherein one only has access to one knife he may perform נעיצה to switch between meat and dairy.

#### Salt Dishes:
It is prohibited to place a salt dish (an uncovered utensil containing salt) near a meat or dairy dip, lest some of the dip fall into the dish, get hidden by the salt, and then, when the salt is used at a different meal of the opposite kind (milk or meat), the meat/milk dip that fell into the salt will get combined, along with the salt, with the milk/meat of the meal (שו"ע צה:ה). This stringency would not apply to a bowl of vinegar, even though it is also placed on the table at meals (שם), because the dip will dissolve in the vinegar, and therefore has the ability to become בטל, so we're not as worried (ט"ז וש"ך שם).

This law only applies if the salt dish is uncovered, as there is a possibility the dip will fall in, and is only לכתחילה. If one did place the salt near the dip, we do not need to assume that the dip fell into the salt (רמ"א שם). 
##### Salt in Meat/Dairy Utensils:
If one uses a clean, בן יומו meat/dairy utensil as a salt dish, the salt does not absorb flavor of meat or milk and can therefore be used for dairy/meat (שו"ע צה:ז). This would also be true for a clean, בן יומו utensil of איסור, the salt would not absorb אסור flavor and would remain permitted for use with other food (ש"ך שם ס"ק כה).

The רמ"א rules that there are those who are stringent not to place salt in a meat/dairy dish^[Specifically if the utensil is made of earthenware (כלי חרס) (פ"ת צה ס"ק ח).] if he might use it later with dairy/meat, and one who is stringent like this opinion "תבא עליו ברכה".

#### Contact:
The combination that we are safeguarding against is one that cannot be undone, such as liquids mixing together or בליעות of milk penetrating meat (or vice versa). Contact between cold solids (meat and cheese), however, is not something we are very concerned about, as [[#General Contact|all that needs to be done to rectify the situation is to rinse]] ([[Measurements#Surface Level|הדחה]]) [[#General Contact|the points of contact between the meat and cheese]]. Additionally, the transgression if one were to eat it without הדחה [[#^5033f6|would only be rabbinic in nature]]. Furthermore, if one were to roast or salt the meat or cheese so that the residue is absorbed [[Measurements#כדי קליפה|כדי קליפה]] (and certainly if one were to cook the meat so that the residue is distributed throughout the entire piece of meat), the residue is such an insignificant amount that the meat or cheese wouldn't even need קליפה (see פ"ת ס' צא ס"ק א). Therefore, one can even wrap meat and cheese in the same bundle and not worry that they might come into contact with each other (שו"ע צא:א).
##### Bread:
One must be careful not to allow his bread to come into contact with meat or dairy (other than bread he is currently eating with the meat/dairy), lest it come into contact with meat and subsequently be eaten with dairy (or vice versa) (שו"ע צא:ג). If the bread and meat *did* come into contact, the bread requires [[Measurements#Surface Level|הדחה]] (see ש"ך שם ס"ק ד) if the meat touched the crust and [[Measurements#גרידה|גרידה]] if it touched the crumb (פ"ת שם ס"ק ד).^[This differs from the normal law regarding rinsable residue, where, while in most cases we can't allow the items to come into contact לכתחילה, we do not need to be careful to avoid contact. The reason bread is different is that bread is commonly eaten with both meat and cheese, and so there is a strong likelihood that a piece of bread that touches meat will be eaten with cheese and vice versa (פ"ת שם).]
#### Storage:
One is allowed to store milk and meat near each other in a closet (or in a refrigerator) (שו"ע צה:ו), because people are careful to keep meat and milk from mixing (ט"ז שם ס"ק יז). The רמ"א (שם) says that although this is true, one should be stringent to keep them separate if he doesn't have a specific need (such as storage constraints). The ש"ך (שם ס"ק כד)  says that this stringency only applies when the meat and milk are uncovered, if they're covered there's no concern that they will mix.


### Sharp Foods (דבר חריף) and Knives:
![[תערובות#^4853de]]
#### What's Considered חריף:
Radishes and beets are considered חריף (certain varieties) (שו"ע צו:א), but their leaves are not^[The רמ"א in ת"ח brings an או"ה that the leaves of radishes and beets *are* considered sharp, just to a lesser extent than the radish itself, therefore they absorb flavor from the knife [[Measurements#כדי קליפה|כדי קליפה]] (ש"ך ס' צו ס"ק יא)] (רמ"א שם). Garlic, onions^[Small, sweet onions (presumably either shallots or Vidalia onions) are not fully חריף, and therefore will not be מכליא לשבח in a scenario that would lead to loss (פ"ת ס' צו ס"ק ג).]^[Onions that are cooked (presumably sauteed as well) are not considered חריף anymore, as the cooking sweetens them (פ"ת ס' צו ס"ק ד).], leek, and similarly sharp foods, along with sour (acidic) fruits^[The רמ"א in ת"ח rules that sour apples are not considered חריף. Therefore, in a situation where ruling apples to be חריף will result in a loss, we can rely on the ת"ח that an apple is not חריף, in conjunction with the opinion that only חילתית is a דבר חריף (ט"ז ס' צו ס"ק ט)] and salted fish, are all considered חריף (שו"ע שם סע' ב). The (שם) רמ"א adds horseradish and ginger to the list^[Presumably the שו"ע agrees and just included it in "similarly sharp foods."].

The שו"ע (שם סע' ג) rules that spices (and salt, ש"ך שם ס"ק יח) are considered חריף, and will therefore absorb flavor from the grinder when ground, although only if the grinder is בן יומו. The רמ"א (שם) brings an opinion (like which we rule, ש"ך שם) that spices are חריף enough to absorb flavor, and become אסור/meat thereby, even if the grinder was not בן יומו. 
#### When Sliced With a Knife: 
![[תערובות#^ba3114]]

Consequently, if the knife contained was used for hot meat within 24 hours, or even if it was used more than 24 hours earlier but it still had meat residue on the surface, the radish would not be able to be eaten with dairy until it had a נטילה removed, or if he tasted the radish and was unable to detect flavor of meat, at which point it can just be [[Measurements#Surface Level|rinsed]] (שו"ע שם).

The שו"ע brings an opinion that even if the knife was clean and had only been used for hot meat more than 24 hours earlier the radish will still need to have a נטילה removed before it can be combined with dairy. This is because the sharpness of the radish reinvigorates the flavor ([[תערובות#Reinvigorating the flavor (מכליא לשבח)|מכליא לשבח]]) like חלתית does (ש"ך שם ס"ק ו).

The שו"ע continues that if one didn't remove the נטילה and cooked the radish with dairy, if the total contents of the pot is greater than 60 times the נטילה or the blade of the knife, whichever is smaller^[If the blade is smaller than the נטילה, then we need 60 times the blade, because since the blade is the source of the meat flavor in the נטילה, the נטילה can't contain more meat flavor than could have been contained in the knife, i.e. up to the volume of the blade. If the נטילה is smaller than the blade, then we need 60 times the נטילה, as the נטילה can't hold a volume of בליעות that is greater than its own volume.], the mixture is permitted. If not, the mixture will be rendered בב"ח. 

The שו"ע ends off that the above would all be true for a knife that contains בליעות of איסור as well. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ו) says that we, who [[#^bec037|argue on the שו"ע and hold that חנ"נ applies to all prohibitions, not just בב"ח]], rule that even if the blade was smaller than the נטילה, if the radish gets mixed with permitted food, one would need 60 times the נטילה, because when the radish was sliced the בליעות of איסור prohibited the whole נטילה due to חנ"נ.

The רמ"א (שם) adds that if the radish was diced (so each piece is only the size of a נטילה), then one would need 60 times the whole radish. The ש"ך (שם) elaborates:
+ If the knife contained flavor of meat/milk, the above would only be true if the blade had a greater volume than the radish, so there would be enough בליעות in the knife to permeate all of the radish. Otherwise, if one cooked the whole radish with dairy, one would only need 60 times the blade. If we no longer have access to the knife and we don't know its volume, we assume that it had a greater volume than the radish. If one combined a piece of the radish with dairy, we have to assume that the piece was fully permeated with meat flavor^[Even if there was not enough flavor in the knife to permeate the whole radish, since we don't know how the flavor distributed, when dealing with individual pieces we must account for the possibility that the distribution of flavor disproportianately affected the individual pieces we're dealing with.] and the dairy therefore needs to be 60 times larger than the piece of radish.
+ If the knife contained flavor of איסור, then we need 60 times the whole radish, even if the knife was smaller than the radish. This is because we have to assume that the איסור distributed just enough flavor to each piece of the radish to render that piece prohibited (meaning each piece would absorb more than 1/60 of its volume of אסור flavor), and then חנ"נ would say that we need to treat each piece as fully prohibited.

The רמ"א (שם) brings an opinion that even if one only made a single slice in a דבר חריף (e.g. he cut a radish in half), the sharpness of the food draws the flavor throughout the דבר חריף, rendering the whole item אסור (or meat/dairy, depending on what was absorbed in the knife). The רמ"א rules like this opinion לכתחילה, but says that בדיעבד^[As to what is considered בדיעבד here, the ש"ך (ס' צ"ו ס"ק י) says that if it was sliced its still considered לכתחילה, only if it was then cooked with היתר/meat/dairy is it considered בדיעבד. The מ"י (הובא ברעק"א שם) says that in the case of a knife of איסור, if the radish was sliced it's בדיעבד, except in a case where it was sliced by a non-jew and there are other radishes available to buy, such a radish would be considered לכתחילה and therefore fully אסור.] the radish is only אסור כדי נטילה. ^801208

##### If the Status of the Knife is Uncertain:
If we are not sure if the knife used to slice the דבר חריף contained איסור or not, the דבר חריף is permitted^[This permit relies on the fact that [[תערובות#סתם כלים אינם בני יומן|סתם כלים אינם בני יומן]] (even though we have a rule that a knife is preumed to be unclean, that's a small amount of איסור and so we don't need to take it into account, מ"י הובא ברעק"א שם), in conjunction with the fact that many opinions rule that חילתית is the only דבר חריף that is מכליא לשבח. If we knew that it was בן יומו, and we were only unsure if it was used for איסור or if the אסור knife was the knife used, this case would be a ספק דאורייתא and we would rule stringently (ש"ך ס' צו ס"ק יב).]. Therefore we may buy דברים חריפים, such as radishes or ginger, that were harvested by non-jews, because there's a good chance that the radishes were harvested using a utensil that is dedicated for harvesting, rather than a general-purpose knife that presumably contains בליעות of איסור. If we know the radish was cut with a knife, then if there are no other radishes available we may buy from the non-jew and just remove a נטילה (because this is considered בדיעבד^[If there *were* other radishes available to buy, this would be considered לכתחילה and one would not be allowed to buy the radishes from the non-jew (ש"ך ס' צו ס"ק טו).], see [[#^801208|above]])  (רמ"א צו:ב).

Similarly, one may buy lemon juice or salted fish from a non-jew that the non-jew "brought in barrels" (i.e. made in bulk) (שו"ע  שם סע' ד). This because even if the non-jew used a knife of איסור, the איסור will become בטל in the large volume of lemons/fish^[only if the lemons were halved (sliced once). If they were quartered (sliced twice, with the second slice bisecting the first) the איסור will never become בטל, because the knife will emit איסור into the lemon with the first slice and that section of the lemon will become חנ"נ. When the second slice passes through that area, the new חנ"נ איסור will be absorbed by the knife and thereby imparted to the next lemon, where the cycle will repeat itself. ]. Therefore, we may buy chopped (fermented^[ט"ז שם ס"ק יב]) cabbage (presumably sauerkraut) from non-jews, although there are places where the custom is not to buy this cabbage from a non-jew and one should not vary from the custom of his area. Any foods that are not (so^[ט"ז שם ס"ק יג]) acidic, like apples may be bought when produced in bulk (רמ"א שם).


##### Slicing Non-חריף Foods:
If one slices a non-חריף food, like a cucumber, with a meat knife, there are no בליעות transferred, and so the cucumber may be eaten with dairy. If the knife was dirty, the food needs to be cleaned of residue before it can be eaten with dairy, so something moist and soft like a cucumber needs to have the area of the slice scraped away^[Fish that is recognizably kosher (such as salmon) but was sliced with a knife that was used for non-kosher fish may be scrubbed at the point of contact with the knife and it is permitted (פ"ת ס' צו ס"ק ה).], while something hard like a turnip^[לפת in the שו"ע, which the  ש"ך שם ס"ק כב translates as ריבי"ן, or rüeben in german, which translates to turnip.] only needs [[Measurements#Surface Level|הדחה]] (see שו"ע צו:ה).
###### Turnip:
Turnip has a special property, namely that if one slices a turnip with a meat knife and then slices a דבר חריף like a radish, the radish will not absorb meat flavor because the turnip residue on the knife neutralizes the חריפות of the radish (שו"ע שם), but only on the first slice immediately following the slicing of the turnip (רמ"א שם). That said, one cannot rely on this לכתחילה, meaning if one has a meat  knife and wants to cut חריף dairy, he may not slice a turnip and then slice the dairy, but if he does, the dairy will be permitted (ש"ך שם ס"ק כב).
