 Cooking (בישול) is used as both a general term to refer to food preparation and as a specific term to refer to preparing food in heated water (or other fluids, see below). ^8df37a
 
## מראת עין
Whether cooking (a mixture that is intrinsically permitted to be cooked but not eaten, in an instance where an observer seeing this might be misled that eating such a mixture or a similar mixture that is likewise prohibited) can be prohibited because of מראת עין is debated by the ט"ז and ש"ך (יו"ד פז:ד).
The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ה) holds it can, but the ש"ך (שם ס"ק ז) that it cannot because any observer can assume that he's cooking the (seemingly) forbidden mixture for medicinal or other non-eating purposes. [^1] ^abd781

[^1]: The problem with the ש"ך is that his point that seeing someone cook won't lead to the assumption that eating is permitted because there are other valid reasons to cook doesn't help by בשר בחלב because it's prohibited מדאורייתא to *cook* meat and milk together, so even if an observer thinks that the cooking of, say, chicken and milk is for medicinal purposes, we should be worried that he'll conclude that cooking *meat* and milk for medicinal purposes is permitted. R' Yitzchok Dov Lefkowitz told me in the name of R' Heinneman that the ש"ך can be explained as holding like the כסף משנה (see הל' טומאת מת, פרק א הלכה ב) who holds that cooking בשר בחלב is only prohibited מדאורייתא if it is being cooked *for the purpose of eating*. Therefore, if someone sees another person cooking chicken with milk, assumes that it's meat and milk, assumes that he's cooking the mixture for medicinal purposes, and therefore concludes that cooking meat and milk for medicinal purposes is permitted, he still won't transgress an איסור דאורייתא because he didn't cook the meat and milk for the purpose of eating.

## תתאה גבר:
When something hot comes into contact with something cold, whether the hot item heats the cold item or the cold item cools the hot item, the consequence being whether the items cook together and thereby transfer flavors to each other, is debated in the Gemara (source). We Pasken that whichever item is lower (although according to many this is actually interpreted to mean the stationary item) extends its state to the upper (moving) item (תתאה גבר), so if the lower (stationary) item is hot, it makes the upper (moving) item hot as well, and flavor transfers throughout both. If, however, the upper (moving) item is hot and the lower (stationary) item is cold, the lower cools the upper and the two items just need [[Measurements#כדי קליפה|קליפה]]^[The reason [[Measurements#Surface Level|הדחה]] is not enough, even though they're both cold, is that the cooling is not instant and in the time it takes for the upper item to cool the flavor can transfer כדי קליפה (see ש"ך יו"ד ס' צא ס"ק  ז).] (see שו"ע יו"ד צא:ד). ^ba819c

## Cooking After Removal From the Flame (כלי ראשון/שני/שלישי):
### כלי ראשון:
When a pot of food that has been heated to [[תערובות#יד סולדת|יד סולדת]] is removed from the flame, it retains its ability to cook additional food that is placed in it until it cools to below יד סולדת. This is called a כלי ראשון.
### כלי שני:
If the food in the pot is moved to different utensil, the food loses most of its ability to cook, *even though it's still יד סולדת*,  and, as far as שבת can only cook קלי הבישול, but as far as תערובות can still, according to some, cause בליעות to transfer.

### כלי שלישי:
If [[#כלי שני|כלי שני]] food is further moved to a third utensil, it has no ability to cook or transfer בליעות, again *even though it's still יד סולדת*.
