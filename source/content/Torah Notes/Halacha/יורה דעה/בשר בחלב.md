## The Prohibition:
The Torah prohibits [[בישול - Cooking#^8df37a|cooking]] meat and milk together, and prohibits the product of such cooking from being eaten or benefitted from.  (ש"ע יו"ד פז:א)

The derivation for this law is as follows: the Torah writes (שמות כג:יט, שם לד:כו, דברים יד:כא) לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו (Thou shalt not cook a goat in its mother's milk) three times. The ברייתא says ([:גמ' חולין קטו](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=115b&format=pdf)) that the Torah wrote this פסוק three times in order to prohibit 1. cooking, 2. eating, and 3. benefitting from a combination of meat and milk.

The רשב"א teaches (:ת"ה הקצר ב"ג ש"ד פד) an important caveat: the Torah only prohibits eating and benefitting from a combination of meat and milk that has been cooked together. He derives this from the fact that all three פסוקים use the language of "don't cook," even though two of them are referring to eating and benefit, respectively.

It is important to note that this only constitutes an absolute permit to *benefit* from a meat/milk combination that has not been cooked together, *eating* such a combination, on the other hand, is prohibited מדרבנן.  ^5033f6

Cooking a meat/milk combination of which one or both components are only considered meat or milk מדרבנן is permitted (in regard to the basic הלכה; see below regarding [[מראת עין#^6d2017|מראת עין]]). (שו"ע יו"ד  פז:ג) As well, benefitting from any meat/milk combination that is only prohibited מדרבנן (whether because of the cooking method or the ingredients) is allowed. (רמ"א בהגה יו"ד פז:א) 

## Definitions:
There are three terms that must be defined in order to understand the prohibition of בשר בחלב: [[#Cooking|cooking]], [[#Meat|meat]], and [[#Milk|milk]].


### Cooking: 
In the context of בשר בחלב, cooking has two definitions: a general definition of causing flavor to transfer, and a specific definition of cooking in water or other liquids. When the Torah prohibits cooking meat and milk, it means the second definition of cooking in water (שו"ע יו"ד פז:א) (when heated by a flame, not [[#Cooking in Hot Springs (חמי טבריא)|the sun or hot springs]]), and possibly [[#Roasting (צלי)|roasting]], [[#Cold into Hot|putting cold meat into hot milk or vice versa]], [[#Pan-Frying|pan-frying]], [[#Smoking (מעושן)|smoking]], and [[#Cooking in Hot Springs (חמי טבריא)|cooking in water heated by hot springs or other non-flame sources]].

#### Possible דאורייתא Cooking Methods:

##### Roasting (צלי): 
There is some debate whether roasting בשר בחלב is prohibited מדאורייתא or only מדרבנן.
The פרי חדש is of the opinion that it is מדאורייתא (see יו"ד ס' פז ס"ק ב for his proofs.) רעק"א (שם) brings proofs that the ר"ן argues and holds that roasting is not a דאורייתא method of cooking בב"ח.
##### Cold into Hot:
![[בישול - Cooking#^ad0c62]]

As a consequence of this, when cold milk falls onto hot meat or vice versa, according to many this would be considered akin to roasting, as the hot base would heat the cold item falling onto it, causing flavors to transfer between them, rendering the mixture בשר בחלב.
##### Pan-Frying:
The פרי חדש is of the opinion that it is מדאורייתא (see יו"ד ס' פז ס"ק ב for his proofs.)
The פ"ת (שם ס"ק ג) brings the מ"י and the מהר"ם שיף who argue and say it is only מדרבנן.

R' Lefkowitz told me that deep frying is considered cooking, not frying. (Although רשי in :סנהדרין ד seems to me to indicate otherwise)
##### Smoking (מעושן):
There is a debate about what kind of smoking is referred to here. It can either mean hot smoking, in a situation where the heat is indirect, or it can mean cold smoking, i.e. sawdust is burned to create a large amount of smoke in an enclosed space where  meat and cheese are in contact, the smoke penetrates the food items and causes flavor to transfer between them.  ^237ec2

Whether smoking is considered בישול in the context of בשר בחלב is an undecided debate in the ירושלמי, so we consider it a ספק דאורייתא (biblical doubt). We therefore treat it like בישול due to the rule of ספק דאורייתא לחומרא (we rule stringently in a biblical doubt), but because it is only  out of doubt the court does not prescribe lashes for such cooking (מגיד משנה הל' מ"א פ"ט ה' ו). The ש"ע (יו"ד פז:ו) agrees with this מ"מ, but the גר"א (שם ס"ק טו)  argues that smoking *should* be considered cooking דאוריייתא, citing a גמ' שבת that says smoking is considered cooking regarding שבת.^fa19bd

##### Cooking in Hot Springs (חמי טבריא):
Hot springs are used as the Talmudic shorthand for heat that is not derived from fire. The other example of such heat is solar-derived heat. 
It is compared in the ירושלמי to מעושן, so it shares its [[#Smoking (מעושן)|laws]]. ^548c25
###### Electricity:
I spoke with R' Yitzchok Dov Lefkowitz, and he told me that whether electric cooking falls under this category depends on the method of heating: 

A directly solar powered kettle (such as the rooftop hot water heaters common in Israel, known locally as a דוד שמש) is considered by some authorities to be indirectly heated by the sun and by some to be directly heated by the sun (with consequences for the laws of שבת), either way such a kettle would fall under the category of non-flame heats.

A standard electric stove *is* considered by most authorities to be a flame-based heat, because the coil is heated to the point of glowing (like why incandescent bulbs are considered fire for various הלכות).

A microwave and an induction stove are controversial, because R' Moshe Feinstein holds that any normal cooking method is considered בישול, but there are those argue.


#### Definite דרבנן Cooking Methods:
##### Soaking (כבוש):
Soaking food for 24 hours in liquid causes [[תערובות#^2d098f|בליעות]] to transfer as if the mixture and the utensil it is contained in were cooked. However, meat and milk that are soaked together are *not* considered to have been cooked together מדאורייתא, as only flame (or heat, depending on the status of [[#^548c25|חמי טבריא]]) derived cooking is included in the biblical prohibition of בשר בחלב. That said, if one were to cook meat that had been soaked in milk or vice versa, that *would* be cooking בשר בחלב מדאורייתא.

That's all as far as דאורייתא is concerned, but if meat and milk were soaked together they would be [[#^5033f6|prohibited מדרבנן to be eaten]]. 


### Meat:
Meat is the flesh of a living creature. As such, there are five categories of meat, respectively the flesh of a:
#### Domesticated Animal (בהמה):
In the context of בשר בחלב, only the meat of a kosher domesticated animal (בהמה טהורה) is prohibited מדאורייתא. When mentioned unqualified, this is what meat refers to. The meat of a non-kosher בהמה is addressed [[#^29cba1|here]].

##### Blood:
Blood, although it is [prohibited to be consumed](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.3.17?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he), is not included in the laws ofבשר בחלב ([:גמ' חולין קיג](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) and is therefore permitted to be cooked with milk and such a mixture is permitted to be benefitted from. (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ו) ^918d9f

There is a debate whether cooked blood is (רמב"ם הל' מ"א ט:ו) or is not ([רש"י מנחות כא.](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=21&format=pdf)) included in the prohibition against consuming blood. According to those who permit cooked blood, blood *is* included in בשר בחלב מדרבנן. Therefore, everyone agrees that it's prohibited to consume blood cooked with milk, either because cooked blood is prohibited or because it is included in בשר בחלב מדרבנן.
##### Fetus (שליל):
A fetus found in a properly slaughtered domesticated animal is considered full-fledged meat and so has the same laws as a normal [[#Domesticated Animal (בהמה)|domesticated animal]]. 
##### Amniotic Sac (שליא):
an [amniotic sac](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amniotic%20sac) is excluded from the laws of בב"ח by the same exclusion as [[#^918d9f|blood]].
##### Quasi-Edible Parts:
The following is a list of animal parts that are only quasi-edible and are therefore not considered to be meat מדאורייתא, although מדרבנן they are still prohibited^[The ש"ך as interpreted by the פ"ת holds that this prohibition is just for eating, while others argue and say its even for cooking.] (שו"ע יו"ד פז:ז):
* Skin^[Skin that is exceptionally soft, such as that of the fatty tail, would be considered full-fledged meat.]
* Ligaments & Tendons
* Bones
* The soft roots of the horns 
* The soft roots of the hooves 

#### Undomesticated Animal (חיה):
The meat of a חיה is consistently grouped with that of [[#^60e550|birds]], and so shares their laws.

#### Bird (עוף):
Birds are permitted מדאורייתא to be eaten with milk, but are treated as meat מדרבנן and are therefore prohibited to be eaten with milk ([[#^28bf18|even of a חיה]]). As such, it is permitted to be cooked with milk and for the product of such cooking to be benefitted from. Whether such cooking is actually allowed in practice or is prohibited because of מראת עין is disputed by the (יו"ד פ"ז ס"ק ה) ט"ז and the (שם ס"ק ז) ש"ך. The ט"ז says explicitly that it's prohibited, while the ש"ך says that [[בישול - Cooking#^abd781|there is no מראת עין]] by cooking at all, so obviously he would hold that to cook bird meat with milk is permitted.   ^60e550

Unless otherwise specified, when chicken is mentioned in these laws, all kosher birds are included, chicken is just a common example.

##### Eggs:
Eggs that have been laid are permitted to be combined with meat or milk. If they have not yet been laid and were found within a slaughtered chicken, whether they are considered part of the mother, and therefore forbidden to be combined with milk, or like laid eggs that can be combined with milk, depends on what stage of development they have reached.

###### The Development of Chicken Eggs Within the Mother:
Chickens that are in their egg-laying state (which they are now kept in permanently, by artificial means, so they produce eggs every day) have multiple eggs at various stages of development within them at a given time, each roughly a day ahead of the next. They start as yolks attached by a veiny membrane to the ovary where they grow. When the yolk has grown to full size, the membrane splits, releasing the yolk. The yolk then moves to the next stage where it is surrounded by the white, then a membrane, then the shell.

###### At What Stage of Development is an Egg Considered an Independent Entity:
The שו"ע (יו"ד פז:ה) says that once the egg has a white, it is considered an independent entity and is permitted to be combined with milk. This would even be true in a scenario where, instead of splitting and releasing the yolk, the membrane detached and remained surrounding the yolk beneath the white. If the egg has not yet developed a white, it is considered meat and cannot be combined with milk. Eating such an egg (so long as the yolk is fully developed) does not, however, require the eater to wait before eating dairy.  The ש"ך (שם ס"ק יב) says this is true even if the veiny membrane is still on the yolk.

The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ו) says that the women have a custom to treat even a fully completed egg with a shell to be considered meat if it was found within a slaughtered chicken, and this custom should be followed. However, he says that if the egg was already combined with milk, as long as it has developed the membrane found beneath the shell. ^710fda

The ש"ך (שם ס"ק י) holds that even if the egg has developed the membrane around the white, it still cannot be combined with milk. However, if it has already been combined with milk the mixture is permitted to be eaten, so long as the egg has developed a white and the veiny membrane is not still around the yolk. That said, if prohibiting the mixture would result in a large financial loss, we can rely on those who hold that an egg is permitted to be combined with milk so long as the egg yolk has completely developed, even if it is surrounded by the veiny membrane.

He argues on the ט"ז, and says that as long as one is not in a place that explicitly follows the [[#^710fda|women's custom]], we are not bound by it.
#### Fish (דג):
Fish are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ג), but they are practically prohibited from being eaten with meat due to a סכנה (health risk) (ב"י או"ח סימן קע"ג).  ^c8139e

The ב"י adds (יו"ד פז:ג) that there is also a סכנה when they are combined with milk. Because of this, many sects of ספרדים will not eat fish with milk either.  ^961f2e

The רמ"א says (דרכי משה שם ס"ק ד) that this ב"י must be due to a printing error, as the source that the ב"י quotes says fish and *meat*, not milk. ^0aaf36
#### Grasshopper (חגב):
Technically this category should be insects, but grasshoppers ([only certain species](https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/19/Q1/)) are the only kosher insects. Because this is the case, there is no halachic term (that I am aware of) that refers to insects and includes grasshoppers as well.

Grasshoppers are like [[#Fish (דג)|fish]] in that they are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ג), but differ from fish in that there is no סכנה concern associated with their combination with either meat or milk. 



### Milk: 
#### דאורייתא:
The only milk that is prohibited under the laws of בשר בחלב מדאורייתא is that of a kosher בהמה. There are milk derivatives, some retain their status of milk and so are included מדאורייתא, and some are considered to have lost their milk status.
##### Whey:
Whey is a by-product of the cheese-making process. Rennet is introduced to milk, which causes the formation of curds from the fat of the milk. Those curds are then removed and processed further into cheese. The "milk" left behind is called whey.

The ראש (הובא בטור יו"ד פז:ח) says that whey retains its milk status and is forbidden to be combined with meat מדאורייתא. 
#### דרבנן:
##### חיה:
The milk of a kosher חיה is included in the laws of בשר בחלב מדרבנן (פ"ת יו"ד ס' פז ס"ק ז). 

In fact, the milk of a חיה is even prohibited to be combined with the meat of a חיה  or bird (רמבם הל' מאכלות אסורות ט:ד).  ^28bf18

##### מי חלב:
The step below whey is מי חלב, which is whey that has been cooled off, so the remaining fat floats to the top, and then skimmed, leaving a thin watery substance. This substance is only prohibited to be combined with meat מדרבנן. (ראש הובא בטור יו"ד פז:ח) 
##### חלב מתה:
The milk found in a dead animal, whether it was slaughtered properly or it died otherwise (ש"ך יו"ד פז ס"ק יד), is not included in the prohibition of בשר בחלב מדאורייתא, but it is prohibited מדרבנן to be eaten with meat (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ו) or cooked with meat (רמ"א בהגה שם). The reason it is not considered milk מדאורייתא is that the גמרא ([:חולין קיג](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) says that the פסוק says חלב אמו even though it could have just said חלב to exclude חלב מתה. The גמרא uses this same reasoning to exclude [[#Male Milk|male milk]] and [[#Milk of a Non-Kosher Animal|the milk of a non-kosher animal]]. ^91309e

##### Rennet:
Rennet is milk found in the belly of a nursing calf. It contains enzymes from the stomach lining which make it a crucial component of the cheesemaking process.

According to most opinions, when it is found congealed in the stomach it is not considered to be milk, rather it is considered a waste product. It can therefore be combined with meat (שו"ע יו"ד פז:ט). The ש"ך (שם) adds that although congealed rennet is technically permitted to be combined with meat, one should not intentionally do so because of [[מראת עין#^6d2017|מראת עין]].

Even when the rennet is found in a fluid state, the מחבר says it is not milk, but cites an opinion that it *is* considered milk and cannot be combined with meat. The רמ"א concurs with this stringent opinion. (שו"ע שם)
###### Rennet In Cheesemaking:
Rennet that has sat in the stomach of the animal for 24 hours post-slaughter is considered to have been [[#Soaking (כבוש)|soaked]] with it and is therefore prohibited to be used to make cheese, as the בליעות of meat it absorbed from the stomach will be mixed in to the cheese. The same would apply if the stomach was salted before the rennet was removed. (שו"ע יו"ד פז:י)

The רמ"א (שם) adds that one should not even allow the rennet to remain in the stomach long enough for the stomach to cool down to room temperature, but if one did wait that long the rennet is not prohibited.

If rennet that was left in the stomach for 24 hours was used to make cheese, the status of the cheese depends on the state of the rennet  (רמ"א שם):
1. **The Rennet Was Fluid:** If the rennet was fluid then the cheese is prohibited unless [[תערובות#ביטול בששים|the quantity of milk used to make it was 60 times greater than the quantity of rennet used.]] 
2. **The Rennet Was Found Congealed:** If the rennet was found congealed in the stomach it is considered waste and therefore even the meat flavor it absorbed is considered to be waste. Because of this, the cheese made with it is not prohibited.
3. **The Rennet Was Found As A Fluid But Later Congealed:** The primarily accepted opinion is to treat such rennet as fluid and therefore prohibit cheese made therewith. There are, however, opinions who treat such rennet as congealed, therefore in a case where prohibiting the cheese will constitute a significant loss we are lenient and permit the cheese.
##### Male Milk: 
The milk of a male animal that has a genetic abnormality which causes the animal to have udders (see [רשי חולין קיג: ד"ה ולא בחלב זכר](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) is [[#^91309e|not included in בשר בחלב מדאורייתא]]. However,  מדרבנן it is included in the prohibition. (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ו)
#### מראת עין:
There are various "milks" that are prohibited due to מראת עין, however the specifics of that prohibition is different for each:

##### Almond Milk:
Almond milk, while not truly milk at all, has enough of an appearance of milk that the רמ"א (יו"ד פז:ג) requires meat combined with almond milk to be served with almonds (or some other indicator) nearby to show that the "milk" is not truly milk. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ד) extends this to include chicken with almond milk, but he holds that if you don't have almonds, you can still eat the chicken (ב"ה שם ס"ק ו) or the meat (פ"ת שם ס"ק י). The ש"ך (שם ס"ק ו), however, disagrees with this ט"ז, based on a מהרש"ל, and holds that without an indicator it would be prohibited to eat even a mixture of *chicken* and almond milk. The פ"ת (שם) adds that chicken with almond milk would only require an indicator if it was served at a large meal, where there would be a real concern of מראת עין, but in a private setting an indicator would not be required. ^1697a8

R' Yitzchok Dov Lefkowitz told me in the name of R' Heinneman that since non-dairy "milks" have become so widespread, there is no longer an issue of מראת עין, because an observer that sees a mixture of meat and a milk alternative will assume that it's not real milk. Because of this, the Star-K allows restaurants under its supervision to serve non-dairy milk in an unmarked metal container, as opposed to their old policy of requiring the milk to be brought out in its original container that clearly says "almond milk."

##### Mother's Milk:
Human breast milk, while it is both a true milk and permitted to be consumed even by adults (once it has been separated from its source), is not included in the laws of בשר בחלב. However it is prohibited (at least with meat, see the discussion of [[#^1697a8|almond milk regarding combinations with chicken]]) under the laws of מראת עין and, unlike almond milk, there is no solution available of placing an indicator next to the dish. However such milk is nullified in a simple majority so long as it cannot be seen in the dish.  (שו"ע יו"ד פז:ד)
###### Human Male Milk:
In the event of an abnormality which causes a man to produce milk, it would share the laws of mother's milk. (רמ"א יו"ד פז:ו as explained by the ש"ך)

##### Milk of a Non-Kosher Animal:
The milk of a non-kosher animal is [[#^91309e|not prohibited under the laws of בשר בחלב to be combined with meat.]] Of course such a combination (or the reverse, non-kosher meat with kosher milk) is forbidden to be eaten, but that is just because the milk was already prohibited to be eaten as the milk of a non-kosher animal. It is, however, permitted to cook and benefit from such a mixture (שו"ע יו"ד פז:ג). ^29cba1

The רמ"א (שם סעיף ד) says that it is forbidden to cook such a mixture because of מראת עין, although he does not extend this to chicken/non-kosher milk. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ה) considers the רמא's reasoning to be flawed but is hesitant to permit that which the רמא prohibits. The  ש"ך, on the other hand, [[בישול - Cooking#^abd781|holds that cooking cannot be prohibited as מראת עין at all]], so he disagrees with the רמ"א and permits such cooking.



## Laws:

### Secondary Flavor Transfer (נותן טעם בר נותן טעם):
We know that food cooked in a utensil [[תערובות#^2d098f|transfers its flavor into the utensil]], that [[תערובות#^4c4a72|food subsequently cooked in that utensil receives that flavor from the utensil]], and that [[תערובות#^10325d|the flavor being present is as if the food it came from is present]]. Therefore, if one cooks meat in a pot and then cooks dairy in that pot ([[תערובות#בן יומו|within 24 hours]]), even if the pot is clean, the dairy will receive flavor of meat and be prohibited as בב"ח [[תערובות#^09539d|unless the dairy has a volume that is 60 times that of the meat flavor that was contained within the walls of the pot]].

Such a scenario would be called a prohibited secondary flavor transfer (נותן טעם בר נותן טעם דאיסורה): a primary flavor transfer from the meat to the pot and a secondary transfer of that same flavor from the pot to the dairy, which results in a prohibition, i.e. בב"ח. 

There is a special law that in the event of a *permitted* secondary flavor transfer, like the above case but with fish instead of dairy (Meat>Pot>Fish), the meat flavor is considered to have been weakened to the point of exclusion from [[תערובות#^10325d|טעם כעיקר]]  and the fish can therefore be eaten with dairy^[And the fish itself can be eaten, [[#^0aaf36|according to the רמ"א]] even though it would be [[#^c8139e|prohibited due to סכנה had it absorbed the flavor directly from the meat]].]^[At least as far as the laws of בב"ח. [[#^961f2e|According to the מחבר himself, such a combination of fish and dairy is practically prohibited due to סכנה]].], even though the fish would not be permitted to eat with dairy had it absorbed the same quantity of flavor directly from the meat (שו"ע יו"ד צה:א).

### Dehydrated Meat:

One of the methods used to make cheese is to place a piece of the stomach in the milk, so that the stomach enzymes cause the milk to curdle. This would normally be prohibited as the combination of meat (the stomach) and milk, and if the resulting cheese contains a detectable flavor of meat, the cheese would be prohibited (שו"ע יו"ד פז:יא).^[The reason the meat is able to be nullified even though it is a [[תערובות#מעמיד|מעמיד]] is that the stomach is not [[תערובות#^76ef63|intrinsically prohibited, it's just its combination with milk that is prohibited.]]]

The רמ"א (יו"ד  פז:י) proposes a solution to this problem wherein one could dehydrate the stomach until it is so dry that it's "like wood and has no moisture of meat." Such flesh can be used to make cheese, as the dry enzymes will still have an effect but there will be no flavor of meat transferred into the milk.

The ש"ך (שם ס"ק לג) argues on the רמ"א and says that one may not intentionally do use dehydrated stomach to curdle cheese, although he agrees that if it was used the resulting cheese would be permitted.

He adds that the same dehydration process would also remove the ability to impart flavor from the other intestines.

### Safeguards Against Cooking:
#### The Stringencies of the רמ"א:

The רמ"א in יו"ד פז:ו lists four stringencies that one should keep to avoid the inadvertent transgression of the laws of בשר בחלב:
1. One should not stoke the flame upon which a non-Jew's pot is cooking, because even if there is not currently meat *and* milk in the pot, the pot might have recently been used to cook meat or milk and now be cooking the opposite, which would be considered cooking בשר בחלב, due to the current meat mixing with the [[תערובות#בליעות & טעם כעיקר|בליעות]] of the milk (or vice versa) that were previously in the pot.^[the reason this is only a stringency and not an actual prohibition is that we have a rule that [[תערובות#סתם כלים אינם בני יומן|סתם כלים אינם בני יומן]], and so the non-jews utensil presumably was not used within the last 24 hours to cook meat/milk (or anything else).]   
2. One should not combine wash-water that has been used to clean meat pots with wash-water that has been used to clean dairy pots, even to give to his animal, "because such a mixture is prohibited to benefit from."^[This statement is puzzling, because, as the ש"ך points out, what would the prohibition be? The ש"ך therefore concludes that the case is where the waters were combined hot, and they are therefore true בשר בחלב. This is also problematic because, as רעק"ע points out, it would be forbidden to make such a combination to begin with, as that would be cooking בשר בחלב. Furthermore, if it becomes actual בשר בחלב, how can the רמ"א conclude that it is just a stringency not to feed the water to one's animals, it is an איסור דאורייתא of benefitting from בשר בחלב? Perhaps the רמ"א means that such a mixture would be prohibited from benefit if it were hot and so says even such a mixture when cold should be avoided, which would explain why it's just a stringency and not a prohibition.]
3.  A pot used for making shampoo (the primary ingredient of which was ash at the time) should not be used to cook food, because the ashes used in the shampoo would be taken from the stove and so would contain drippings of meat and of milk from previous cooking, meaning that בליעות of בב"ח are contained in the pot.^[The reason this is just a stringency is presumably סתם כלים אינם בני יומן.]
4. The furnaces used to heat the houses in Europe in the רמ"א's time would have a built-in pot for boiling water (not for food purposes). Pots of food would be placed in the furnace to cook, and the food would occasionally splash onto the walls of the built-in pot. Now, they would cook both meat and milk (not simultaneously) in these furnaces, which means that the built-in pot would contain בליעות of both. Therefore, the built-in pots should not be used for cooking food.^[This as well is presumably due to סתם כלים אינם בני יומן. The ש"ך (שם ס"ק כא) adds that if the built-in pot is made of metal it can be cooked in even according to the רמ"א because it's constantly being heated to the point of [[תיקון כלים#ליבון קל|ליבון קל]] by the normal firing of the furnace.]

### Safeguards Against Combination:

#### Joint Placement on a Table:
It is prohibited to place meat, even of [[#^60e550|birds]] or [[#Undomesticated Animal (חיה)|undomesticated animals]], on a table upon which someone is eating dairy, due to the concern that [[#^5033f6|the one eating meat may eat some of the other's dairy over the course of the meal or vice versa]] (שו"ע יו"ד פח). This law was enacted against the possibility of one casually and unthinkingly eating the other's food. With that in mind, there are a few conditions for this law, without which casual and unthinking eating of the other's food would be unlikely:

1. The two people must have a basic level of familiarity with each other.. ^[The accepted opinion (שם ט"ז ס"ק ב וש"ך ס"ק ד) is that this even holds true if the two people have an animosity which would cause them not to share, because we don't want to make the law nuanced, which could lead to mistakes.]
2. The table is the one where the *eating* is taking place, this prohibition doesn't apply to a serving table.
3. The two are sitting near enough that one can reach the other's food (פ"ת שם ס"ק ג בשם ב"ח בשם רש"ל).
4. There is nothing placed between the two of them to serve as a reminder not to eat the other's food. ^[A third-party watcher would not fulfill this requirement (רעק"א שם), the reminder must be an object that serves as a constant reminder directly to the eaters.]
##### What Qualifies as a Reminder:
As the purpose of the item being placed on the table is to be a constant reminder to those eating not to partake of the other's food, the item must be something that will continually be noticed due to the irregularity of its presence. This precludes any item that would have been on the table even had they both been eating meat or milk, such as a candelabra at night.

###### Separate Tablecloths:
If the two parties are eating on separate tablecloths or on separate placemats (as long as they are not accustomed to using placemats, psak from R Tzvi Yaakov Stein), that would qualify as a reminder.
###### Bread:
A loaf of bread placed between the two parties qualifies as a reminder (שו"ע יו"ד פח:ב) but only if the two of them are not eating from that loaf (רמ"א שם). 

The רמ"א adds that although this is true, in our scenario of two people, one eating meat and the other eating dairy, they shouldn't actually eat from the same loaf because of bits of food that can adhere to the loaf.^[This would presumably not hold true if the loaf was sliced, but I don't have any proof of this.]

###### A Shared Cup:
If a cup that would not normally be on the table even if it was in use, then even if they are both drinking from it it would would qualify as a reminder (רמ"א שם).

The רמ"א adds that although this is true, in our scenario of two people, one eating meat and the other eating dairy, they shouldn't actually drink from the same cup because of bits of food that can adhere to the cup. Similarly, they should each have their own salt dish.^[This probably wouldn't apply if they use a covered saltshaker like is normal nowadays, as opposed to dipping plates where meat or dairy may fall in, but I again have no proof of this.]



#### Waiting Between Meat and Dairy:
##### Dairy After Meat:
One may not eat dairy immediately after eating meat, even of [[#Bird (עוף)|birds]] or [[#Undomesticated Animal (חיה)|undomesticated animals]] (שו"ע יו"ד פט:א). This is because we are worried that the dairy will mix with the meat that was previously eaten, either because meat leaves a lingering taste in the throat when swallowed ([רשי  חולין ק"ה. ד"ה אסור ](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=105&format=pdf)) or because bits of meat get stuck in between the eater's teeth (רמב"ם הל' מ"א ט, כח).  ^24c9c9

We rule stringently to take both opinions into account, therefore one must wait even if one chewed food without swallowing (even though, according to רשי, the waiting period is only triggered by swallowing); if one found meat between his teeth after the waiting period he must remove it^[Finding such meat does not extend the waiting period, it continues from the time of the original eating (ש"ך יו"ד ס' פט ס"ק ג), but the finder must [[#Cleansing the Palate (קינוח)|cleanse his palate]] (רמ"א שם סע' א) and rinse his mouth (ש"ך שם ס"ק ד)before eating dairy.] (even though, according to the רמב"ם, any meat remaining between the teeth after the waiting period is no longer considered meat and need not be removed^[This is because the רמב"ם holds that the source for the waiting period is the verse הבשר עודנו בין שיניהם (במדבר יא:לג) (lit. The meat was still between their teeth) which by, virtue of referring to particles of meat stuck between the teeth as meat, teaches us that such particles are considered meat, and even so, the רבנן said that after the waiting period, one can eat dairy, meaning that we no longer consider the particles between the teeth to be meat.]); and one must wait after eating fat like after meat^[Even though it doesn't stick in the teeth.] (see רמ"א יו"ד פט:ג).

###### Length of the Waiting Period:
The source for waiting between meat and dairy is a גמרא ([חולין ק"ה](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=105&format=pdf)) that prohibits eating dairy after meat in the same meal but allows dairy "in a different meal."

The שו"ע (יו"ד פט:א) interprets this as requiring one to wait the standard length of time between two meals, which in the time of the גמרא was six hours^[The hours referred to here are standard hours (60 minutes) not proportional hours (1/12 of the day or night).], before eating dairy after meat.

The רמ"א (שם) brings another opinion that interprets the גמרא completely differently. According to this interpretation, when the גמרא prohibits dairy after meat until "the next meal" it means that literally, so that all one would need to do is finish the current meal, say a ברכה אחרונה^[The רמ"א brings an opinion that one shouldn't make a ברכה אחרנה during his meal in order to eat dairy, but rules that we don't need to follow this opinion. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ג) vehemently argues on this רמ"א because the thing that makes one allowed to eat dairy is the fact that it's being eaten during a separate meal. It can't be considered a separate meal if one is eating continuously, stopping only to make a ברכה אחרנה. The ברכה אחרנה would only help if the first meal had been legitimately concluded (such as by davening mincha, like many do on shabbos to eat shaleshudos). The ט"ז goes so far as to say that "one who fears the word of G-d should avoid sitting at the same meal with those who are not scrupulous in this matter"], and start a new meal of dairy.^[According to this opinion, if he didn't make a ברכה אחרנה, then so long as the meal during which he ate meat can still be considered ongoing, he cannot eat dairy, even after six hours pass. (ש"ך יו"ד ס' פט ס"ק ה)] According to this opinion he would also need to [[#Cleansing the Palate (קינוח)|cleanse his palate]] and rinse his mouth^[The order is not important, rinsing first would also be effective (ש"ך שם ס"ק טו).] before eating dairy.^806c6e

The רמ"א then brings the custom of his region which was to wait an hour between meat and dairy as a sort of compromise position between the two interpretations. Those following this custom are required to adhere to the stringencies of the רמ"א's first [[#^806c6e|opinion]], namely to make a ברכה אחרונה and cleanse the palate.

The רמ"א ends off that there are those that are "fastidious" to wait six hours, and that this is the proper thing to do. 

If one just chewed meat without swallowing, there's no need to be stringent and wait six hours instead of one. This is because [[#^24c9c9|according to רשי]] there is *no* waiting period required in such a situation, as the lingering flavor he considers the basis of the waiting requirement lingers in the *throat* and is therefore only triggered by *swallowing* meat, so  in this case one can rely on the combination of רשי who would require no waiting and those who generally only require an hour (רעק"א שם). Presumably he would apply this same logic to one who ate fat, because fat doesn't stick in the teeth and so would not trigger any waiting period according to the רמב"ם.

###### Cleansing the Palate (קינוח):
In order to remove flavor from one's mouth, one must do קינוח (lit. wiping), which we will refer to as cleansing the palate. It is accomplished by eating something that will scrape his mouth somewhat, like bread or a cracker, but not with something sticky, like flour, dates, or vegetables, as they don't work well for this purpose (שו"ע יו"ד פט:ב). The food must be swallowed, not just chewed (פ"ת שם ס"ק ה).


##### Meat After Dairy:
Unlike [[#Dairy After Meat|eating dairy after meat]], there is no waiting period to eat meat after eating dairy (שו"ע יו"ד פט:ב). This is because the two reasons that are given for the post-meat waiting period, namely lingering flavor and pieces stuck between the teeth, do not apply to dairy, which doesn't stick in the teeth or leave a lingering flavor. Therefore, one who eats dairy and wants to eat meat need only check his hands for dairy residue^[The פמ"ג (הובא בפ"ת שם ס"ק ד) and the ר"פ and עט"ז (הובא בב"ה שם ס"ק ה) say that unless one doesn't have water, he should be stringent to wash his hands even by day when there is amplel light, unless he is eating with utensils, in which case he doesn't need to wash his hands (פ"ח הובא בב"ה הנ"ל).] (or, at night when there's not enough light^[If one had access to a good light (such as modern electric lights) then he can just check his hands, like by day (ש"ך שם ס"ק ט).], wash them^[With water, not other liquids (ש"ך הובא בב"ה שם ס"ק ו)]), [[#Cleansing the Palate (קינוח)|cleanse his palate]], and rinse his mouth. Even this is only necessary for the meat of a domesticated^[because it is included in בב"ח מדארייתא so we treat it more stringently.] or non-domesticated^[because it is visually similar to the meat of a domesticated animal, even though its only included in בב"ח מדרבנן (ש"ך שם ס"ק יד).] animal, bird meat can be eaten immediately^[because it is only included in בב"ח מדרבנן and is not very similar to a domesticated animal.].

The רמ"א (שם) cites a stringent opinion that requires waiting for the same period as that of [[#Length of the Waiting Period|meat to dairy]] even from dairy to meat (even the meat of birds). He then rules that one should be stringent like this opinion when eating [[#What Qualifies as Hard Cheese|hard cheese]], because it can get stuck between the teeth and it has a strong flavor that lingers, but there are opinions who are lenient and so we should not protest those who don't wait even after hard cheese.

The זוהר (הובא בב"י או"ח קעג:ב ד"ה ואם הוא) describes the terrible spiritual harms that befall one who eats meat and milk "together, in the same hour^[although the word used can be translated as "in the same time period", implying less than an hour], or in the same meal." Because of this, there are those who are stringent to wait an hour between dairy and meat. Those who wait half an hour are presumably combining this with the principle of רובו ככולו (a majority is akin to the whole) to say that waiting just over half an hour is effectively the same as waiting an hour.

The שו"ע (יו"ד פט:ד) continues that in order to eat meat after dairy on the same table where he ate the dairy (or vice versa^[this was presumably discussed in a case of meat after dairy because there is [[#Meat After Dairy|no/a limited waiting period]] after dairy, so it's more likely that one will want to use the same table before it has been cleaned.], see  רמ"א שם) he must clear away all of the remnants of bread on table and must change the tablecloth. The פ"ת (שם ס"ק ח) says that nowadays that we eat from plates, rather than directly off of the tablecloth, we can flip the tablecloth rather than change it.

###### What Qualifies as Hard Cheese:
The ש"ך (שם) says that any cheese that has been aged six months is considered hard. This is the generally accepted practice of those who wait after hard cheese.

The ט"ז (שם) says that only wormy cheese (such as [Casu Martzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_martzu)) or cheese that has been curdled with [[#Rennet|rennet]] (see פ"מ מ"ז שם ס"ק ד) has the lingering taste required to be considered hard cheese.

###### Do Waiters Need to Wash Their Hands:
The רמ"א (יו"ד פט:ג) says, based on a רשי, that the requirement to wash one's hands between meat and dairy only applies to those who are eating, not waiters who just serve the food.

The ש"ך (שם) vehemently argues on the רמ"א and says that there is no difference between the waiters and the diners, and so waiters that touch meat must wash their hands before touching dairy and vice versa, and that the רשי cited by the רמ"א is saying that the waiter doesn't need to wash their hands before handling bread, nothing to do with בב"ח.
 


##### Dishes Containing Meat or Dairy (תבשיל של בשר או חלב):
If one eats a dish that contains meat (such as cholent) but doesn't eat any of the meat itself (he ate only the potatoes^[If he rinsed them, otherwise he must assume that there was liquefied fat present on the potato.]), he can immediately eat an equivalent dairy dish (Ex. the onions out of a French onion soup), or vice versa, with no need to wash his hands (although it is recommended) (שו"ע יו"ד פט:ג). The רמ"א (שם) says that one must wash his hands between.

If after eating such a meat dish one wants to eat actual dairy, or vice versa, he must wash his hands in between (שו"ע שם). The רמ"א (שם) says that the custom has become not to eat actual dairy even after a meat dish just like [[#Waiting Between Meat and Dairy|after full-fledged meat]]. רעק"א (שם) says that by his time the custom had become to wait after a meat dish to eat a dairy dish as if between meat and dairy.

The רמ"א continues that after a dairy dish one would be permitted to eat meat right away, but he must wash his hands, even from a dairy dish to a meat dish. One would also be permitted to eat dairy immediately after a parve (neither meat nor dairy) dish cooked in a pot that had previously been used for meat^[Even if the pot was not cleaned well. We can derive this from the fact that the רמ"א permits eating dairy immediatley *after* the dish, not *with* the dish, which means there must be at least a small amount of meat present, otherwise the dish should be able to be eaten directly with the cheese (ש"ך שם ס"ק יט).].



#### Utensils of Meat and Dairy:
One cannot use a knife that is set aside for meat to cut dairy (שו"ע יו"ד פט:ד), or vice versa (רמ"א שם). In fact, it is even prohibited to cut *bread* that is to be eaten with dairy/meat using a meat/dairy knife. This prohibition is only against initially cutting dairy with a meat knife, but if one already cut the dairy it is not prohibited unless the knife had been used to cut [[תערובות#יד סולדת|boiling hot meat]] [[תערובות#בן יומו|within the last 24 hours]] and the dairy is itself boiling hot.

##### Removing Meat or Dairy Status From a Utensil:
![[תיקון כלים#הסרת בליעות]]
###### Metal Knives:
Metal knives have an extra method of having their meat/dairy status removed, and that is to stab them repeatedly into hard earth (נעיצה בקרקע). That said, this method is not ideal, and the custom has become to have separate knives for dairy and meat, respectively, and to mark^[These marks were seemingly things like notches or other marks that are not clear in and of themselves that they were marking the knife as dairy, which is why the רמ"א says not to differ from the custom to mark the dairy knives specifically, as marking the meat knives instead would lead others assume that the meat knives were, in fact, dairy.] the dairy knives^[Nowadays that we use stickers that say חלבי and בשרי or knives with blue and red handles, it seems that there would be no reason to mark the dairy knives specifically, as our method of marking is unambiguous and a meat knife so marked will be obviously meat to an observer.], and one should not differ from the custom^[According to this, it would presumably be, at least, discouraged nowadays to have a red knife for dairy or a blue knife for meat, as any outsider using the kitchen would think the red is meat and the blue is dairy.] (רמ"א יו"ד פט:ד). The ש"ך (שם) adds that although this is true, in an extenuating circumstance wherein one only has access to one knife he may perform נעיצה to switch between meat and dairy.
