## The Prohibition:
The Torah prohibits [[בישול - Cooking#^8df37a|cooking]] meat and milk together, and prohibits the product of such cooking from being eaten or benefitted from.  (ש"ע יו"ד פז:א)

The derivation for this law is as follows: the Torah writes (שמות כג:יט, שם לד:כו, דברים יד:כא) לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו (Thou shalt not cook a goat in its mother's milk) three times. The ברייתא says ([:גמ' חולין קטו](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=115b&format=pdf)) that the Torah wrote this פסוק three times in order to prohibit 1. cooking, 2. eating, and 3. benefitting from a combination of meat and milk.

The רשב"א teaches (:ת"ה הקצר ב"ג ש"ד פד) an important caveat: the Torah only prohibits eating and benefitting from a combination of meat and milk that has been cooked together. He derives this from the fact that all three פסוקים use the language of "don't cook," even though two of them are referring to eating and benefit, respectively.

It is important to note that this only constitutes an absolute permit to *benefit* from a meat/milk combination that has not been cooked together, *eating* such a combination, on the other hand, is prohibited מדרבנן. 

Cooking a meat/milk combination of which one or both components are only considered meat or milk מדרבנן is permitted (in regard to the basic הלכה; see below regarding [[מראת עין#^6d2017|מראת עין]]). (שו"ע יו"ד  פז:ג) As well, benefitting from any meat/milk combination that is only prohibited מדרבנן (whether because of the cooking method or the ingredients) is allowed. (רמ"א בהגה יו"ד פז:א) 

## Definitions:
There are three terms that must be defined in order to understand the prohibition of בשר בחלב: [[#Cooking|cooking]], [[#Meat|meat]], and [[#Milk|milk]].


### Cooking: 
In the context of בשר בחלב, cooking has two definitions: a general definition of causing flavor to transfer, and a specific definition of cooking in water or other liquids. When the Torah prohibits cooking meat and milk, it means the second definition of cooking in water (when heated by a flame, not the sun or hot springs, עי' שו"ע יו"ד פז:ו), and possibly [[#Roasting (צלי)|roasting]], [[#Cold into Hot|putting cold meat into hot milk or vice versa]] (שם ב"ה ס"ק ב בשם פ"ח) and [[#Pan-Frying|pan-frying]] (שם פ"ת ס"ק ג בשם פ"ח).

#### Possible דאורייתא Cooking Methods:

##### Roasting (צלי): 
There is some debate whether roasting בשר בחלב is prohibited מדאורייתא or only מדרבנן.
The פרי חדש is of the opinion that it is מדאורייתא (see יו"ד ס' ס"ק ב for his proofs.)
The 
##### Cold into Hot:
![[בישול - Cooking#^ad0c62]]

As a consequence of this, when cold milk falls onto hot meat or vice versa, according to many this would be considered akin to roasting, as the hot base would heat the cold item falling onto it, causing flavors to transfer between them, rendering the mixture בשר בחלב.
##### Pan-Frying:
R' Lefkowitz told me that deep frying is considered cooking, not frying. (Although רשי in :סנהדרין ד seems to indicate otherwise)
##### Smoking (מעושן):
There is a debate about what kind of smoking is referred to here. It can either mean hot smoking, in a situation where the heat is indirect, or it can mean cold smoking, i.e. sawdust is burned to create a large amount of smoke in an enclosed space where  meat and cheese are in contact, the smoke penetrates the food items and causes flavor to transfer between them. 

Whether smoking is considered בישול in the context of בשר בחלב is an undecided debate in the ירושלמי, so we consider it a ספק דאורייתא (biblical doubt), and so we forbid it due to the rule of ספק דאורייתא לחומרא (we rule stringently in a biblical doubt), but because it is only forbidden out of doubt the court does not prescribe lashes for such cooking (מגיד משנה הל' מ"א פ"ט ה' ו). The ש"ע (יו"ד פז:ו) agrees with this מ"מ, but the גר"א (שם ס"ק טו)  argues that smoking *should* be considered cooking דאוריייתא, citing a גמ' שבת that says smoking is considered cooking regarding שבת.^fa19bd

##### Cooking in Hot Springs:
Hot springs are used as the Talmudic shorthand for heat that is not derived from fire. The other example of such heat is solar-derived heat. 
It is compared in the ירושלמי to מעושן, so it shares its [[#^fa19bd|laws]].
###### Electricity:
I spoke with R' Yitzchok Dov Lefkowitz, and he told me that whether electric cooking falls under this category depends on the method of heating: 

A directly solar powered kettle (such as the rooftop hot water heaters common in Israel, known locally as a דוד שמש) is considered by some authorities to be indirectly heated by the sun and by some to be directly heated by the sun (with consequences for the laws of שבת), either way such a kettle would fall under the category of non-flame heats.

A standard electric stove *is* considered by most authorities to be a flame-based heat, because the coil is heated to the point of glowing (like why incandescent bulbs are considered fire for various הלכות).

A microwave and an induction stove are controversial, because R' Moshe Feinstein holds that any normal cooking method is considered בישול, but there are those argue.


#### Definite דרבנן Cooking Methods:
<p></p>


### Meat:
Meat is the flesh of a living creature. As such, there are five categories of meat, respectively the flesh of a:
#### Domesticated Animal (בהמה):
In the context of בשר בחלב, only the meat of a kosher domesticated animal (בהמה טהורה) is prohibited מדאורייתא. When mentioned unqualified, this is what meat refers to. The meat of a non-kosher בהמה is addressed [[#^29cba1|here]].

##### Blood:
Blood, although it is [prohibited to be consumed](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.3.17?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he), is not included in the laws ofבשר בחלב ([:גמ' חולין קיג](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) and is therefore permitted to be cooked with milk and such a mixture is permitted to be benefitted from. (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ו)

There is a debate whether cooked blood is included in the prohibition against consuming blood and according to those who permit cooked blood it *is* included in בשר בחלב מדרבנן, so practically speaking it is always prohibited to consume blood cooked with milk, either because cooked blood is prohibited or because it is included in בשר בחלב מדרבנן.

#### Undomesticated Animal (חיה):
The meat of a חיה is consistently grouped with that of [[#^60e550|birds]], and so shares their laws.

#### Bird (עוף):
Birds are permitted מדאורייתא to be eaten with milk, but are treated as meat מדרבנן and are therefore prohibited to be eaten with milk ([[#^28bf18|even of a חיה]]). As such, it is permitted to be cooked with milk and for the product of such cooking to be benefitted from. Whether such cooking is actually allowed in practice or is prohibited because of מראת עין is disputed by the (יו"ד פ"ז ס"ק ה) ט"ז and the (שם ס"ק ז) ש"ך. The ט"ז says explicitly that it's prohibited, while the ש"ך says that [[בישול - Cooking#^abd781|there is no מראת עין]] by cooking at all, so obviously he would hold that to cook bird meat with milk is permitted.   ^60e550

Unless otherwise specified, when chicken is mentioned in these laws, all kosher birds are included, chicken is just a common example.

##### Eggs:
Eggs that have been laid are permitted to be combined with meat or milk. If they have not yet been laid and were found within a slaughtered chicken, whether they are considered part of the mother, and therefore forbidden to be combined with milk, or like laid eggs that can be combined with milk, depends on what stage of development they have reached.

###### The Development of Chicken Eggs Within the Mother:
Chickens that are in their egg-laying state (which they are now kept in permanently, by artificial means, so they produce eggs every day) have multiple eggs at various stages of development within them at a given time, each roughly a day ahead of the next. They start as yolks attached by a veiny membrane to the ovary where they grow. When the yolk has grown to full size, the membrane splits, releasing the yolk. The yolk then moves to the next stage where it is surrounded by the white, then a membrane, then the shell.

###### At What Stage of Development is an Egg Considered an Independent Entity:
The שו"ע (יו"ד פז:ה) says that once the egg has a white, it is considered an independent entity and is permitted to be combined with milk. This would even be true in a scenario where, instead of splitting and releasing the yolk, the membrane detached and remained surrounding the yolk beneath the white. If the egg has not yet developed a white, it is considered meat and cannot be combined with milk. Eating such an egg (so long as the yolk is fully developed) does not, however, require the eater to wait before eating dairy.  The ש"ך (שם ס"ק יב) says this is true even if the veiny membrane is still on the yolk.

The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ו) says that the women have a custom to treat even a fully completed egg with a shell to be considered meat if it was found within a slaughtered chicken, and this custom should be followed. However, he says that if the egg was already combined with milk, as long as it has developed the membrane found beneath the shell. ^710fda

The ש"ך (שם ס"ק י) holds that even if the egg has developed the membrane around the white, it still cannot be combined with milk. However, if it has already been combined with milk the mixture is permitted to be eaten, so long as the egg has developed a white and the veiny membrane is not still around the yolk. That said, if prohibiting the mixture would result in a large financial loss, we can rely on those who hold that an egg is permitted to be combined with milk so long as the egg yolk has completely developed, even if it is surrounded by the veiny membrane.

He argues on the ט"ז, and says that as long as one is not in a place that explicitly follows the [[#^710fda|women's custom]], we are not bound by it.
#### Fish (דג):
Fish are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ג), but they are practically prohibited from being eaten with meat due to a סכנה. () 

The ב"י adds () that there is also a סכנה when they are combined with milk. Because of this, ספרדים will not eat fish with milk either. 

The רמ"א says (דרכי משה יו"ד סימן פז ס"ק ד) that this ב"י must be due to a printing error, as the source that the ב"י quotes says fish and *meat*, not milk.
#### Grasshopper (חגב):
Technically this category should be insects, but grasshoppers ([only certain species](https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/19/Q1/)) are the only kosher insects. Because this is the case, there is no halachic term (that I am aware of) that refers to insects and includes grasshoppers as well.

Grasshoppers are like [[#Fish (דג)|fish]] in that they are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ג), but differ from fish in that there is no סכנה concern associated with their combination with either meat or milk. 



### Milk: 
#### דאורייתא:
The only milk that is prohibited under the laws of בשר בחלב מדאורייתא is that of a kosher בהמה. There are milk derivatives, some retain their status of milk and so are included מדאורייתא, and some are considered to have lost their milk status.
##### Whey:
Whey is a by-product of the cheese-making process. Rennet is introduced to milk, which causes the formation of curds from the fat of the milk. Those curds are then removed and processed further into cheese. The "milk" left behind is called whey.

The ראש (הובא בטור יו"ד פז:ח) says that whey retains its milk status and is forbidden to be combined with meat מדאורייתא. 
#### דרבנן:
##### חיה:
The milk of a kosher חיה is included in the laws of בשר בחלב מדרבנן (פ"ת יו"ד ס' פז ס"ק ז). 

In fact, the milk of a חיה is even prohibited to be combined with the meat of a חיה  or bird (רמבם הל' מאכלות אסורות ט:ד).  ^28bf18

##### מי חלב:
The step below whey is מי חלב, which is whey that has been cooled off, so the remaining fat floats to the top, and then skimmed, leaving a thin watery substance. This substance is only prohibited to be combined with meat מדרבנן. (ראש הובא בטור יו"ד פז:ח) 
##### חלב מתה:
The milk found in a dead animal, whether it was slaughtered properly or it died otherwise (ש"ך יו"ד פז ס"ק יד), is not included in the prohibition of בשר בחלב מדאורייתא, but it is prohibited מדרבנן to be eaten with meat (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ו) or cooked with meat (רמ"א בהגה שם). The reason it is not considered milk מדאורייתא is that the גמרא ([:חולין קיג](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) says that the פסוק says חלב אמו even though it could have just said חלב to exclude חלב מתה. The גמרא uses this same reasoning to exclude [[#Male Milk|male milk]] and [[#Milk of a Non-Kosher Animal|the milk of a non-kosher animal]]. ^91309e

##### Male Milk: 
The milk of a male animal that has a genetic abnormality which causes the animal to have udders (see [רשי חולין קיג: ד"ה ולא בחלב זכר](https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=113b&format=pdf)) is [[#^91309e|not included in בשר בחלב מדאורייתא]]. However,  מדרבנן it is included in the prohibition. (ש"ע יו"ד פז:ו)
#### מראת עין:
There are various "milks" that are prohibited due to מראת עין, however the specifics of that prohibition is different for each:

##### Almond Milk:
Almond milk, while not truly milk at all, has enough of an appearance of milk that the רמ"א (יו"ד פז:ג) requires meat combined with almond milk to be served with almonds (or some other indicator) nearby to show that the "milk" is not truly milk. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ד) extends this to include chicken with almond milk, but he holds that if you don't have almonds, you can still eat the chicken (ב"ה שם ס"ק ו) or the meat (פ"ת שם ס"ק י). The ש"ך (שם ס"ק ו), however, disagrees with this ט"ז, based on a מהרש"ל, and holds that without an indicator it would be prohibited to eat even a mixture of *chicken* and almond milk. The פ"ת (שם) adds that chicken with almond milk would only require an indicator if it was served at a large meal, where there would be a real concern of מראת עין, but in a private setting an indicator would not be required. ^1697a8

R' Yitzchok Dov Lefkowitz told me in the name of R' Heinneman that since non-dairy "milks" have become so widespread, there is no longer an issue of מראת עין, because an observer that sees a mixture of meat and a milk alternative will assume that it's not real milk. Because of this, the Star-K allows restaurants under its supervision to serve non-dairy milk in an unmarked metal container, as opposed to their old policy of requiring the milk to be brought out in its original container that clearly says "almond milk."

##### Mother's Milk:
Human breast milk, while it is both a true milk and permitted to be consumed even by adults (once it has been separated from its source), is not included in the laws of בשר בחלב. However it is prohibited (at least with meat, see the discussion of [[#^1697a8|almond milk regarding combinations with chicken]]) under the laws of מראת עין and, unlike almond milk, there is no solution available of placing an indicator next to the dish. However such milk is nullified in a simple majority so long as it cannot be seen in the dish.  (שו"ע יו"ד פז:ד)
###### Human Male Milk:
In the event of an abnormality which causes a man to produce milk, it would share the laws of mother's milkץ (רמ"א יו"ד פז:ו as explained by the ש"ך)

##### Milk of a Non-Kosher Animal:
The milk of a non-kosher animal is [[#^91309e|not prohibited under the laws of בשר בחלב to be combined with meat.]] Of course such a combination (or the reverse, non-kosher meat with kosher milk) is forbidden to be eaten, but that is just because the milk was already prohibited to be eaten as the milk of a non-kosher animal. It is, however, permitted to cook and benefit from such a mixture (שו"ע יו"ד פז:ג). ^29cba1

The רמא (שם סעיף ד) says that it is forbidden to cook such a mixture because of מראת עין, although he does not extend this to chicken/non-kosher milk. The ט"ז (שם ס"ק ה) considers the רמא's reasoning to be flawed but is hesitant to permit that which the רמא prohibits. The  ש"ך, on the other hand, [[בישול - Cooking#^abd781|holds that cooking cannot be prohibited as מראת עין at all]], so he disagrees with the רמא and permits such cooking.





## Laws:
##### Safeguards Against Cooking:
###### The Stringencies of the רמ"א:

The רמ"א in יו"ד פז:ו lists four stringencies that one should keep to avoid the inadvertent transgression of the laws of בשר בחלב:
1. Stoking the flame upon which a non-Jew's pot is cooking, because even if there is not currently meat *and* milk in the pot, the pot might have recently been used to cook meat or milk and now be cooking the opposite, which would be considered cooking בשר בחלב, due to the current meat mixing with the [[תערובות#בליעות|בליעות]] of the milk (or vice versa) that were previously in the pot.[^1]    
2. One should not combine wash-water that has been used to clean meat pots with wash-water that has been used to clean dairy pots, even to give to his animal, "because such a mixture is prohibited to benefit from."[^2]
3.  A pot used for making shampoo (the primary ingredient of which was ash at the time) should not be used to cook food, because the ashes used in the shampoo would be taken from the stove and so would contain drippings of meat and of milk from previous cooking, meaning that בליעות of בב"ח are contained in the pot.[^3]
4. The furnaces used to heat the houses in Europe in the רמ"א's time would have a built-in pot for boiling water (not for food purposes). Pots of food would be placed in the furnace to cook, and the food would occasionally splash onto the walls of the built-in pot. Now, they would cook both meat and milk (not simultaneously) in these furnaces, which means that the built-in pot would contain בליעות of both. Therefore, the built-in pots should not be used for cooking food.[^4]


[^1]:the reason this is only a stringency and not an actual prohibition is that we have a rule that [[תערובות#סתם כלים אינם בני יומן|סתם כלים אינם בני יומן]], and so the non-jews utensil presumably was not used within the last 24 hours to cook meat/milk (or anything else).
[^2]:This statement is puzzling, because, as the ש"ך points out, what would the prohibition be? The ש"ך therefore concludes that the case is where the waters were combined hot, and they are therefore true בשר בחלב. This is also problematic because, as רעק"ע points out, it would be forbidden to make such a combination to begin with, as that would be cooking בשר בחלב. Furthermore, if it becomes actual בשר בחלב, how can the רמ"א conclude that it is just a stringency not to feed the water to one's animals, it is an איסור דאורייתא of benefitting from בשר בחלב? Perhaps the רמ"א means that such a mixture would be prohibited from benefit if it were hot and so says even such a mixture when cold should be avoided, which would explain why it's just a stringency and not a prohibition.
[^3]:The reason this is just a stringency is presumably סתם כלים אינם בני יומן.
[^4]:This as well is presumably due to סתם כלים אינם בני יומן. The ש"ך (שם ס"ק כא) adds that if the built-in pot is made of metal it can be cooked in even according to the רמ"א because it's constantly being heated to the point of ליבון
