## ביטול:
Under basic Torah law, in any mixture, so long as it is not perfectly even, the minority is nullified in the majority, and the mixture is treated as purely consisting of the majority. The primary consequence of this is that if something that is forbidden to be eaten gets mixed with food that is permitted (in a scenario where the two components are visually indistinguishable), so long as the permitted food makes up more than 50% of the mixture, the whole mixture may be consumed, with no concern for the prohibited component.

There are, however, myriad exceptions and qualifications to this rule:

### בליעות & טעם כעיקר:
When food is cooked in a utensil, it imparts flavor into the utensil. This flavor is called בליעות (a plural term that literally translates as "absorptions", referring to the particles of flavor that have been absorbed). When the utensil is later cooked in, the בליעות are then emitted by the utensil into the new food being cooked. 

Now, this shouldn't be relevant, as בליעות will be the minority component of any mixture, and will therefore be nullified. There is, however, an exception to the rule of ביטול called טעם כעיקר (lit. flavor akin to essence), which means that so long as something can be tasted in a mixture, even if there is only flavor and no physical essence present, it is considered to be present and not nullified.

#### יד סולדת
The minimum heat required for the transfer of בליעות, (except in the case of כבוש or מלוח, or possibly [[בשר בחלב#^237ec2|cold smoking]]) is יד סולדת (lit. the hand recoils), the temperature at which a person touching the heated item would recoil due to the heat. There are various opinions as to what this temperature is, ranging from about ~104°F to ~165°F. ^764657
#### נותן טעם לפגם:
The exception to טעם כעיקר is if the flavor being imparted is detrimental to the dish it enters, this is called נותן טעם לפגם (lit. imparts flavor deleteriously).

There are three kinds of נותן טעם לפגם: things that are inherently disgusting, things that are not inherently disgusting but produce a bad flavor when combined with specific items, and בליעות that have been absorbed in a utensil for 24 hours.
##### בן יומו:
When בליעות have been contained in a utensil for 24 continuous hours they are considered to be disgusting and are נותן טעם לפגם. Up until 24 hours בליעות are referred to as  בני יומן (of their day) and the utensil containing them is referred to as בן יומו (of its day), after 24 hours they are not בני יומן and are therefore irrelevant except in the case of דבר חריף.

###### סתם כלים אינם בני יומן
We have a rule that a utensil that we don't know how long it's been since it was cooked in is assumed to be אינו בן יומו, and therefore, in a normal case, its בליעות cannot affect anything cooked in it.
