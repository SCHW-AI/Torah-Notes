## בליעות
When food is cooked in a utensil, it imparts flavor into the utensil. This flavor is called בליעות (a plural term that literally translates as "absorptions", referring to the particles of flavor that have been absorbed). When the utensil is later cooked in, the בליעות are then emitted by the utensil into the new food being cooked.
