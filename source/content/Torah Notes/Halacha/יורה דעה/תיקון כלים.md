There are two main scenarios that utensils would need rectification to be usable with food:

## טבילת כלים:

## הסרת בליעות:
When utensils absorb undesirable בליעות (whether non-kosher, חמץ before פסח, or  meat/milk when the owner wants to use the utensil for milk/meat), the method for removing those בליעות depends on two factors: the material from which the utensil is made and the method of cooking that imparted the בליעות.
### Materials:
#### Earthenware:
Earthenware can never be fully purged of בליעות, so an earthenware utensil that absorbs from forbidden foods will forever prohibit anything cooked in it, if it absorbed from חמץ it cannot be used on פסח and in fact must be destroyed before פסח if not sold to a non-jew, and if it was used for meat/milk it can never be used for milk/meat.

#### Glass: 
According to most authorities, glass is incapable of absorbing בליעות and so can never become prohibited (or חמץ or meat/milk) to begin with.
#### Metal:
