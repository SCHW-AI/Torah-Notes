## Depths of Absorption:
### כדי נטילה:
There are certain flavor transfers that penetrate a fingerbreadth into the target. Such cases are referred to as absorbing כדי נטילה (lit. to the point of removal), and the area of absorption is itself referred to as a כדי נטילה or just the נטילה.

### כדי קליפה:
There are certain flavor transfers that only penetrate to a minimal depth within the target, the depth being the thinnest layer of that substance that can be peeled away without falling apart. This is referred to as כדי קליפה (lit. to the point of peeling), and the area of absorption is itself referred to as a כדי קליפה or just the קליפה.
